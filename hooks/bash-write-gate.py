"""bash-write-gate.py — the Bash door onto the write policies that already exist.

WHY THIS EXISTS, proven in one session on 2026-08-09 rather than argued: the
linkedin-engagement-daily run wrote a vault markdown file with a `python3 -c`
command from Bash and it SUCCEEDED. Minutes later the identical change through
Edit was BLOCKED with record-home-gate.py's full refusal text. Nothing about the
content differed. THE SAME CONTENT WAS REFUSED OR ALLOWED PURELY BY WHICH TOOL
CARRIED IT, because every write gate here matches Write|Edit|MultiEdit and Bash
is a door none of them watch. Rule 14181e60 (database first) is enforced by
record-home-gate.py, so it held only against sessions that were not going to
break it anyway.

THE THREAT MODEL IS CARELESSNESS, NOT EVASION, and that is not a guess. The run
that found this had no intent to bypass anything: it reached for Bash because the
content carried URLs another guard had just refused, discovered the write gate
only when Edit refused a follow-up correction, and then stopped rather than
repeating it. An unintentional bypass by a compliant session is stronger evidence
that a control is mis-scoped than a deliberate one would be. A gate written
against a determined adversary would need to be complete or worthless; a gate
written against a convenient tool needs to cover the shapes people reach for.

THIS GATE DECIDES NOTHING, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Two gates already hold the
judgment about where a write may land — record-home-gate.py owns the vault,
one-repo-gate.py owns code outside the repo. A third policy for Bash would be the
two-homes disease one layer down, and the copies would drift the first time
either changed. So this file EXTRACTS candidate write targets from a shell
command and hands each one to those policies unchanged. One judgment, three
doors: rule a8c55a47 (a manual path and an automated path that do the same job
must be the same code) applied to tool doors rather than to scripts.

WHAT IT EXTRACTS, and each shape is here because it is one somebody reaches for:
  · redirections — `> f`, `>> f`, `>| f`, `&> f`, `2> f`, with or without a space
  · heredocs written to a file — `cat > f <<EOF`, which is the redirect above
  · `tee f` and `tee -a f`
  · `sed -i` over a named file
  · `cp` / `mv` / `install` destinations
  · `dd of=f`, `truncate f`
  · inline interpreters — `python -c`, `python3 -c`, `node -e`, and heredocs fed
    to them — scanned for path literals ONLY when the code also carries a write
    indicator, so a read-only one-liner is not caught

TOKENISED, NOT REGEXED OVER RAW TEXT, and that difference is the gate's
survival. `git commit -m "throughput a > b now"` contains a `>` that is not a
redirect. A raw regex fires on it, on every commit whose message contains a
comparison, and the gate gets switched off within a day. shlex sees one quoted
token and correctly finds no redirection.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IGNORES: /dev/* targets, `2>&1` and its relatives, reads of
any kind, and every path both delegated policies allow.

THE RESIDUAL, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. Extraction cannot be complete against
arbitrary shell. A path assembled from variables at runtime, an interpreter this
file does not know, a script invoked by name that writes on its own, a base64
payload decoded and executed — none are seen here. This closes the shapes that
are actually used, not the space of things that are possible. Anyone reading this
should treat it as raising the cost of an accidental bypass, never as proof that
one cannot happen. The complete control for that is enforcement at the filesystem
or at the record layer, which is a larger build and a separate decision.

FAILS CLOSED ON DENY, OPEN ON ERROR — exit 2 plus stderr, matching
guard-unattended.py and record-home-gate.py. A gate that wedges a session costs
more than the marginal safety of failing closed on a single-operator machine, so
any internal error allows the call.

# The first version paired two loose tests: "does this code contain any path
# literal" and, separately, "does this code contain any write indicator". Applied
# to a `python3 <<PY ... PY` heredoc it flagged a path the script only READ,
# because some other line in the same script wrote something else. A verification
# command of my own tripped it, which is how it was found — and it would fire on
