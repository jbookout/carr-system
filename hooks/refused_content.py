"""refused_content.py — a blocked markdown write cannot be hidden elsewhere
(rule 76a53dfe).

THE RULE: a blocked markdown write is RE-ROUTED THROUGH THE VERBS, never
written somewhere the gate does not look.

THE HOLE, named in the rule's own text and still open when probed on
2026-08-14. The record-home gate refuses record content aimed at the vault,
through the file tool and — since the Bash hole closed the same day — through
the shell as well. The identical content written to a scratchpad or the temp
directory was refused by nothing. The content lands somewhere the record layer
never sees, which is the outcome the rule exists to prevent; only the
destination changed.

WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE WRONG ONE, and this is the whole design. Refusing
markdown writes to scratch paths would refuse the pull-request bodies, probe
scripts and backups every session writes constantly — the session that built
this wrote nine such files while building it. That gate gets removed within a
day, and then the hole is open again with a note saying it was tried.

So the memory is SEQUENTIAL rather than positional. What is remembered is the
content a gate just REFUSED; what is stopped is substantially the same content
reappearing anywhere afterwards. A scratch write unrelated to any refusal stays
free, which is almost all of them. Same shape as the resend check in
conduct-stop-gate.py: keep what was blocked, compare the next attempt.

MATCHING IS ON THE BODY, NOT THE BYTES. Whitespace, case and a swapped heading
must not launder a record past this, so comparison is over normalised content
lines with the majority of them shared. A single quoted line is deliberately
NOT a match: quoting one bullet into a note is discussion, not hiding, and a
gate that refused that would be the noise-generating version of itself.

FAILS OPEN everywhere, and never raises into a caller: a memory that cannot be
read costs one comparison, and a gate that wedges on its own bookkeeping is
worse than the hole it closes.
