"""executor-tier-gate.py — make the executor an explicit choice, not a default.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three active rules already say the executor must be named and
must be the cheapest one still qualified: the subagent cost gate (2dbb0ad8),
the executor-choice rule whose audit signal is a stated "executor: <tier>" line
(185013c6), and the rule reserving the frontier model for its best use cases
(fb110a39). All three are PROSE. Nothing enforced them, and on 2026-08-13 a
live test showed exactly what that costs: a `general-purpose` subagent spawned
with no `model` parameter reported back "You are powered by the model named
Opus 5 (1M context)". It inherited the parent tier silently, and nothing in the
transcript said so.

That is the whole leak. The fifteen custom CARR agents pin a model in their own
frontmatter, so they are safe by construction. The GENERIC types — the ones a
session reaches for when it wants a cheap mechanical sweep, `general-purpose`,
`Explore`, `Plan` — define no model at all, so per the Agent tool's own contract
they "inherit from the parent". The parent here is pinned to Opus. A session
intending a throwaway grep and forgetting one parameter buys the whole sweep at
top tier, and the report still reads clean.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not the Claude Code 2.1.223 "restricted subagent model"
warning. That warning was assessed on 2026-08-13 and CANNOT fire here: nothing
on this machine restricts any model (no managed settings, no MDM profile, no
restricting key or env var), and none of CARR's model-request sites fall into
the four categories it covers. It was checked before this was built, so nobody
re-proposes it later as the fix for this.

WHAT IT CHECKS. One question, at the one detectable moment: an Agent spawn is
about to happen and NOTHING has named the tier it will run on.

  · `model` passed on the call            -> allow. The executor is named.
  · `subagent_type: fork`                 -> allow. The Agent tool documents
                                             model as ignored for forks; they
                                             always inherit the parent, so
                                             denying would demand the
                                             impossible.
  · a definition file pinning `model:`    -> allow. The job description names
                                             its own tier, which is the point
                                             of pinning it there.
  · none of the above, and Jev is
    confident (>= ACT_AT) in a tier    -> ALLOW WITH JEV'S PICK FILLED IN as
                                           the call's `model` (updatedInput),
                                           said in the context line. Jev acts:
                                           the tier is now a decision, made by
                                           Jev and visible (Joe, 2026-09-24,
                                           decision 5ec806a4: every Jev check
                                           acts).
  · none of the above, and Jev is
    unavailable or not confident       -> DENY, naming what it would have
                                           cost and how to fix it, exactly as
                                           before Jev acted. An abstaining
                                           judge never loosens the gate.

IT DENIES RATHER THAN WARNS, which is the opposite of
its neighbour rule-shape-gate.py, and the difference is deliberate. That gate
warns because blocking would make `teach` refuse a partner's own words, which
it must never do. Here the cost of a false stop is one round trip and one
extra parameter, while the cost of a warning is that it gets clicked past —
and prose that gets clicked past is precisely the failure being fixed. A gate
that only warns would be the same aspiration in a new costume. Jev acting
removes the round trip when it is confident, never the deny when it is not:
a vendor outage leaves the gate exactly as strict as it was before Jev.

FAILS OPEN on any error, like every other hook here. A gate that crashes must
never be able to stop work. Logged to out/hook-guard.log.
