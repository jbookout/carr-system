"""weekend-quiet-gate.py — Saturday and Sunday are not workdays (rule 236ca227).

THE RULE: weekends are off for both partners. Joe and Dell do not work them,
and the system does not go looking for them on one.

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, from the 2026-08-14 enforceability audit and verified
still open the moment before this was written. The session brief STATES the
policy at boot, and nothing denied a weekend ping. The record layer has no send
verb at all — that half is structurally absent, which the audit records — but a
session reaches the partners through tools the record layer never sees: a push
notification, and the mail connector that drafts and sends to Joe's own
address. No hook matcher covered either, and no code anywhere looked at the day
of the week.

WHY THIS ONE IS ENFORCEABLE WHERE MOST OF ITS NEIGHBOURS ARE NOT. Most of the
audit's partial rows are advisory because their binding condition needs
judgment. "Is it Saturday" is a predicate (rule 5e89c211: never spend a
cognition token on a decision a predicate can make).

THE EXCEPTION IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART, and it is the rule's own: "human elects
to work weekend". A partner typing into a session on a Sunday IS that election
— he is at the keyboard, he opened the session, and refusing to answer him
would be absurd. So this reads his keystrokes, exactly as escalation-gate.py
does for its "he asked" exemption, and a session cannot grant itself the
exemption by asserting he is around.

SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW: partner-facing SENDS only. Reads, record writes,
loop filing, peer messages between sessions, and every other tool are untouched
whatever the day. The weekend rule is about not pestering two people on their
days off, not about stopping the system from working — the nightly chain, the
scheduled jobs and the record layer all run through the weekend as before, and
should.

FAILS OPEN on every error, including a clock it cannot read: a gate that cannot
tell the day must not guess, and a wedged session costs more than one push
notification arriving on a Saturday.

    His own keystrokes are the election the rule names, and they are the one
    signal a session cannot fabricate for itself. Harness-injected turns are
    NOT his words — the same distinction ledger-sweep.py got wrong on
    2026-08-05 when it quoted a task notification as the partner speaking.

    THE ORIGIN ALLOWLIST WAS GUESSED, AND THE GUESS WAS WRONG (defect 16291f00,
    2026-08-22). It accepted kinds "user" and "keyboard". The harness has never
    written either: a typed turn carries origin {"kind": "human"}. So every real
    keystroke was rejected as non-keyboard, the carve-out could not fire once,
    and the gate refused a notification on a Saturday Joe had personally
    authorised two turns earlier. The selftest passed throughout because its own
    fixture wrote {"kind": "user"} — the code's assumption, checked against
    itself. Measured across sixteen real transcripts, the accepted set matched
    zero turns out of 3,271 candidate records.

    SO THE VALUES BELOW ARE OBSERVED, NOT ASSUMED, and they stay an allowlist
    rather than becoming a denylist of injected kinds. A denylist fails OPEN:
    an origin kind nobody has seen yet would count as the partner speaking, and
    a session could self-authorise its own weekend send off a notification —
    exactly the 2026-08-05 mistake. An unknown kind is refused AND LOGGED, so
    the next drift is visible in out/hook-guard.log rather than silent for a
    week. That logging is the actual repair; the missing value is just the bug.
