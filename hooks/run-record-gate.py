"""Run record-backed hooks with the repository interpreter, never ambient Python.

Claude invokes hook commands through system Python, which intentionally has no
project dependencies on this Mac.  These gates need psycopg for the canonical
record read, so the interpreter is an explicit, baseline-protected part of the
hook contract.  PATH and environment never choose the interpreter.

FAILURE DIRECTION (reversed 2026-08-23, and why).  This wrapper used to return 2
on every bootstrap fault, writing nothing anywhere.  Exit 2 on a Stop hook
BLOCKS, so the session saw "No stderr output" and could neither comply nor
diagnose; it read as a wedged session for roughly ten consecutive turns.  Three
things make failing closed here wrong:

  * hooks/SETTINGS-BLOCK.md is the standing ruling on this machine — hooks fail
    open, and every allow-on-error lands in out/hook-guard.log so a degraded
    gate stays discoverable.  Silent-and-closed inverted that on both axes.
  * Both wrapped gates already fail OPEN on their own internal errors
    (`log("ALLOW(internal-error)"); sys.exit(0)`).  The launcher was stricter
    than the thing it launches.
  * This wrapper never reads stdin, so it never sees `stop_hook_active` — the
    de-escalation both gates rely on to stop after one block.  A bootstrap fault
    therefore blocked EVERY turn, unbounded, with no way for the session to
    satisfy it.  A fresh worktree with no .venv is a real, expected state here.

So a bootstrap fault is now a LOUD open gate: one line to stderr, one line to
the log, exit 1 (non-blocking) rather than 2 (blocking).  What must never happen
again is the silence, not the allow.
