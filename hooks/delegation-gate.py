"""Observe task-sticky delegation for CARR Claude Code sessions -- never deny.

REDESIGNED 2026-08-27 (WR-000019 slice S4). Across 18 days this gate's PreToolUse
denial produced 35,322 rows in out/delegation-gate.jsonl -- 19,796 sticky_latch,
14,137 second_mechanical_call, 1,389 executor_allowed_after_retry -- the single
largest friction source in the system. The GOAL it exists to serve is real and
unchanged: route mechanical work to the cheapest qualified seat when a
delegation latch is active. The MECHANISM -- denying the session's OWN tool
calls one at a time, with a retry loop to dodge a transcript-write race -- is
what retires here.

WHAT CHANGED. This file no longer returns exit 2 or {"decision": "block"} from
anywhere. Every PreToolUse call this gate used to deny is now silently
classified exactly as before (same is_broad/is_mechanical/sticky-task logic,
same "one lookup is free, the next one trips it" thresholds) and the
classification is recorded into a per-session counter bucket kept in the
existing state ledger (out/delegation-gate-state.json, now carrying a third
top-level key, "telemetry", alongside the unchanged "tasks"/"sessions" latch
bookkeeping). Nothing about the LATCH -- which session owns which delegated
task, when it resumes, when it releases -- changed; it is still exactly the
sticky_task() state machine this file has always kept, because "latch state"
is one of the three things a session's telemetry summary reports.

The retry-against-a-transcript-write-race machinery (RETRY_DELAYS,
executor_scan's re-read loop) existed ONLY to avoid denying a call whose
justifying text had not finished landing on disk. Now that nothing is denied,
a missed executor declaration costs nothing worse than one extra telemetry tick
in a session that will get a one-line Stop summary regardless -- so that
machinery is gone with the denial path it protected.

AT STOP, this hook does the other half of the redesign: it reads back this
session's accumulated telemetry bucket, appends EXACTLY ONE summary row to
out/delegation-gate-ledger.jsonl (never one row per call -- ops/delegation-
telemetry-report.py is the queryable per-session view over that ledger), and
speaks an ANNOUNCE-level message (hooks/stop_latch.announce -- the same
non-reopening register five other Stop gates were demoted onto on 2026-08-23)
only when the session materially under-delegated: DELEGATION_GATE_MATERIAL_
THRESHOLD (default 3) or more moments in the session where the old rule's
threshold was reached. A session that never reached that bar gets its ledger
row -- the report can still see it -- but no announcement; the point is that
the PATTERN stays visible in the transcript without ever blocking a call.

hooks/executor-tier-gate.py (which blocks a subagent spawn that names no model
or reasoning effort) is untouched by this slice and remains the enforcing
mechanical control in this space -- this file no longer enforces anything.
