"""peer-broadcast-gate.py — one question goes to one session, not to the room.

WHY (Joe, 2026-08-14): "why are all my sessions repeating there reports. this
shit is burning a lot of wasted tokens. fix it now"

WHAT HAPPENED. A session could not tell which peer owned five modified files, so
it asked nine of them. Seven replied, each with a multi-paragraph inventory of
its own session's work, because a session answering "are these yours" defends
itself by reciting everything it wrote. Every reply also landed in the asker's
context. Sixteen long messages.

The answer had been one command away the entire time. `git diff origin/main`
showed all five files byte-identical to the remote — there was nothing to own.
The "238 lines at risk" had been measured against a local HEAD five commits
behind. Nine sessions were interrupted to answer a question the repository had
already answered.

WHY A GATE AND NOT A RULE. The cost is externalised: the asker pays for one
message and every other session on the machine pays for reading and answering
it. A cost you do not feel is one you do not stop paying, which is what makes
this a bad fit for an advisory rule and a good fit for something that denies.

WHAT IT ALLOWS, deliberately. Replies are never blocked — answering a session
that wrote to you first is a conversation, not a broadcast, and a reply address
(uds:/tmp/cc-socks/...) is how those are addressed. Two named peers per window
are also allowed: asking the likely owner, being told no, and asking the next
best candidate is legitimate targeted work. The THIRD distinct named peer in the
same window is the fan-out this exists to stop.

It gates breadth, not content. It cannot tell whether a question was worth
asking; it can tell that the same session is working through a roster.

OWN SUBAGENTS ARE NOT PEERS (2026-08-14, second false positive that day). An
orchestrating session spawned workers with the Agent tool and messaged them by
agentId (`aabf255ee92301b74`); the gate counted each worker as a "session",
filled the budget with them, and refused the session's own next worker. But the
externalised-cost rationale above is the entire justification for denying, and
it does not apply to a subagent: the reply lands in the asker's own context, so
the asker pays the full cost itself. That is orchestration, not interrogation.

The exemption is PROVEN, never pattern-matched. The hook payload carries this
session's transcript_path, and the transcript records every Agent-tool spawn as
a structural toolUseResult.agentId — so "is this recipient my own subagent" is
answerable from ground truth, the same attribution stance as
staging-attribution-gate.py. A recipient merely SHAPED like an agentId, or an
id that appears only as text inside a message, stays a peer: matching on shape
would let a session spend an unlimited budget on anything named like a hex
token, and #70 already showed what keying identity on spelling does. No
transcript, or an unreadable one, means no exemption — the gate keeps its
protection rather than guessing.
