"""unread-artifact-gate.py — did this session actually OPEN the file it is
describing?

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-14 one session filed four defects against itself and
every one had the same shape underneath: a confident, well-formed claim about an
artifact it had never opened. The evidence was always a PROXY for the artifact —

  · A GREP HIT. "tools/health-check.py writes the radar digest" came from a
    filename match. That file only WATCHES the path, in a staleness table, and
    the ten lines around the hit said so. The wrong name shipped into the one
    message whose entire purpose is telling a job's author which job to fix.
  · A RENDERING. "the write landed on a tombstone" cited three read surfaces as
    three confirmations. They are ONE collection, and the thing under suspicion
    was how records render. A single SQL read settled it the other way.
  · A HEADER, UNREAD. Five files were described as holding content that needed
    routing through verbs. Each declares "GENERATED" in its own first line.
  · AN IMPORTED FUNCTION. A ruling was called drift while the twenty lines above
    the function producing the verdict explained why the verdict had changed.

EVERY OTHER GATE HERE MISSED ALL FOUR, and not by accident. They check claims
against RULES and DECISIONS — record-home against the write law, drift-claim and
drift-assertion against the decision log, chat-lint against the writing rules.
These four statements broke no rule and contradicted no ruling. They were false,
and false in a register that reads as authoritative. A policy gate cannot catch
that, because there is no policy to catch it against.

THE ONE MECHANICAL SIGNAL THEY SHARE: the reply asserts what a file DOES, and the
session never read that file. The transcript records every tool call, so this is
a checkable question rather than a judgement about confidence.

GREP IS NOT A READ, and that is this gate's sharp edge. A grep hit proves a
string occurs somewhere. It says nothing about whether the line is a write, a
watch, a comment, a docstring or a test fixture — which is exactly the
distinction that was got wrong. So a path known only through grep counts as
UNREAD, deliberately, and the refusal says so.

WHAT COUNTS AS KNOWING A FILE: reading it (the Read tool, or cat / head / tail /
sed -n / less through Bash), or having WRITTEN it this session. Authorship is
knowledge; flagging a file the session just authored would make every build turn
noisy for nothing.

WHAT IS NOT THIS GATE'S BUSINESS: naming a path. "Committed hooks/foo.py" asserts
nothing about foo.py, and a gate that fired on it would fire on every status
report and be muted inside a day. Only a path standing as the SUBJECT OF A
BEHAVIOURAL VERB is checked — writes, reads, watches, generates, returns, owns,
contains, handles, and their kin.

IT FIRES ONCE PER CLAIM-SET, AND THE CLAIM-SET IS THE FILES (2026-08-23). It
used to fire once per exact wording — a sha256 of the prose — and that is the
defect the gates-audit council caught next door in hooks/drift-assertion-gate.py,
live, during its own sitting: one changed word ("regression") minted a fresh
identity for an identical finding and the chair was held twice for the same
reading. The identity is now the set of UNREAD FILES the claim names, through
hooks/stop_latch.py, so a reworded restatement is the same finding and stays
quiet while a claim about a different file still speaks.

IT ANNOUNCES, IT NO LONGER REOPENS (2026-08-23, Joe's Stop-gate rationing off
the gates-audit council). It used to exit 2, forcing a whole extra assistant
message. Eleven Stop hooks could do that; one measured shipped session paid nine
such reopens for findings that changed nothing, against a standing constraint of
no steady-state token ceremony. Three keep the power: core conduct,
completion-evidence, drift-assertion.

WHY THIS ONE LOST IT, honestly. The four defects that birthed this gate were
real and it still catches their shape. But a reopen only helps when the next
message is the RESULT OF WORK rather than a restatement, which is the split
hooks/chat-lint-carryover.py drew on 2026-08-16 — and by Stop the sentence has
already reached Joe. Reopening buys a second copy of a message he has read, plus
the read the gate wanted; announcing buys the read alone. The finding still
arrives, in context, at the same moment. If a week of hook telemetry shows
announced unread-artifact findings being ignored where reopened ones were acted
on, the register goes back and this paragraph is why it was tried.

FAILS OPEN ON EVERYTHING ELSE — no transcript, an unreadable record, a parse
error. None may strand a turn.
