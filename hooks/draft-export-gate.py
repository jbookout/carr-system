"""draft-export-gate.py — out/exports/ is a DRAFT, and it says so nowhere the
reader will see it.

THE FAILURE, 2026-08-15, defect 280b1b6c. Asked what was left on Program 4, a
session grepped out/exports/decision-history.md, found one unrelated line, and
told Joe an entire bullet had never been scoped. It had been settled four hours
earlier, in a decision sitting in the LIVE render. The draft copy was thirty-two
hours old. Two turns of work were built on that, and Joe's next instruction was
shaped by it.

WHY THIS DIRECTORY AND NOT ANOTHER. Three properties combine into a trap:
  * It is INSIDE THE REPO, so it is the closest thing to hand when a session
    wants to search decisions, loops or the roster. Nothing about reaching for
    it feels like a shortcut.
  * It is GITIGNORED, so it never travels, never appears in a diff, and no
    review ever notices it went stale.
  * `run.sh export` writes it as a DRAFT by default and only CARR_EXPORT_LIVE=1
    reaches the vault, so its age is bounded by nothing at all.

THE EXISTING BANNER GUARDS THE WRONG HAZARD. Every export carries "GENERATED
from the CARR record layer — do not hand-edit." That protects the file from
being WRITTEN. It tells a READER nothing, and a `grep -c` never prints it.

ANNOUNCE, NEVER DENY, and this is forced by evidence rather than by caution.
Real code reads this directory on purpose: tools/calendar-touch-matcher.py and
tools/mail-touch-matcher.py load the roster and registry from it, and
tools/parity-lead-board.py compares draft against live, which is what a draft is
for. Denying would break working code to prevent a reading mistake. Same posture
as gate_paths.py, and for the same reason: the property worth having is that the
mistake cannot be made QUIETLY.

THE AGE IS THE MESSAGE. "This is a draft" is a label a session skims past.
"This file is 32 hours old, the live render is 5 hours old" is a fact that
changes the next command. So this reports both, measured at the moment of
reading, and names the store as the source that is authoritative regardless.

FIRES ONCE PER SESSION PER FILE. A session legitimately working with a draft
should hear it the first time and then be left alone.

FAILS OPEN on everything: no directory, no file, an unreadable mtime, an
internal error. Debug to out/hook-guard.log.
