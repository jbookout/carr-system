"""machine-converge.py — SessionStart converge for a SECONDARY machine.

JOE'S DIRECTIVE (2026-08-18): Dell's machine must pull and re-apply config
automatically at session start, so it converges to the repo state with no
manual updating. Before this hook, nothing at session start moved a stale
checkout: gate-integrity.py detects drift against the LOCAL repo and its
self-heal reinstalls from the LOCAL repo, so a machine whose CHECKOUT was the
stale thing faithfully reinstalled stale gates and reported success. Dell's
Mac did exactly that for a week after the 2026-08-11 migration.

WHAT IT DOES, on a secondary machine only:
  1. Fast-forwards the CANONICAL checkout's main from origin — ff-only, so a
     diverged tree fails LOUDLY in the session brief instead of merging.
     The refusals mirror bin/fleet-sync.sh (PR #333): never over local
     tracked changes, never off main, never a merge/rebase/reset.
  2. Re-applies machine config with `ops/config-as-code.py install --apply`,
     but only when the pull moved HEAD or `check` reports drift — so an
     already-converged machine boots silently and its launchd jobs are not
     reloaded on every session start.

NEVER `pull`, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING VERB CHOICE (decision #442,
00_Context/decision-history.md 2026-08-17). config-as-code's `pull` captures
whatever the machine has INTO the repo; run against a drifted live plist it
would have deleted the four bin/run-scheduled.sh wrapper lines that commit
4fb58a8a put in com.carr.dictation-consent.plist deliberately — criticality
HIGH, the wrapper is part of what keeps the recording announcement durable,
Florida is all-party-consent, a failure is legal exposure. `install` goes the
other way: it renders the TRACKED template (which carries the wrapper and the
still-recording StartInterval, PR #328) onto the machine, so a converge can
only ever restore the wrapper, never strip it. ops/machine-converge-selftest.py
proves that end-to-end: a live plist seeded WITHOUT the wrapper comes out of a
converge WITH it.

The worktree/canonical catch-22 from the same decision does not bite here:
this hook is always invoked by its canonical path ("${HOME}/carr-system/..."
in .claude/settings.json, same convention as worktree-self-plumb.py), so it
runs the canonical checkout's config-as-code against the canonical templates
— the exact arrangement config-as-code's own {{REPO}} resolution assumes.

MACHINE GATING — the sponsor mechanism, not a hostname. Which human a machine
belongs to is recorded in ~/.config/carr/local-actor.json (written once per
machine by bin/set-local-actor.sh; it is what local-verb.mjs trusts, and the
machine door in mcp-server/src/identity.js maps the same partners server-side,
PR #334). slug "joe" → this is the primary machine and the hook is a NO-OP:
Joe's canonical tree is a shared work surface for live sessions, an unbidden
pull at session start can interleave with another session's push/reconcile,
and the scheduled fleet-sync job covers his staleness case. Any other slug →
converge. When the file is absent (Dell's door provisioning was still owed in
PR #334), fall back to the determinant config-as-code itself uses for
per-machine ownership: git user.email against OWNER_EMAIL in
ops/githooks/pre-push — parsed from that one home, never re-declared. Not
primary → converge, the same fail-closed direction as IS_PRIMARY=false.

CLAUDE-ONLY MACHINES STAY CLAUDE-ONLY. The converge delegates every write to
config-as-code, whose install path treats an absent ~/.codex as a supported
state and skips Codex without creating it (CLAUDE.md, Dell migration
contract). The selftest asserts no ~/.codex appears.

FAIL-SOFT, ALWAYS — same discipline as worktree-self-plumb.py: a boot-time
convenience must never fail or block a session. Refusals and failures are one
loud LINE in the brief, never a blocked boot.
