"""record-home-gate.py — the PreToolUse DENY gate on records written to markdown.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe, 2026-08-03: "you cant write a .md file you have to write to
the database... it is one of the worst mistakes that can be made in this database
system. writing a .md file creates a big issue. its undetectable to the system."

He is right about undetectable, and that is the whole defect. Every OTHER control
in this system that matters has a mechanism behind it: destructive Bash has
guard-unattended.py, taught-rule shape has rule-shape-gate.py, prose quality has
lint-gate.py, the ledger rules have ledger-sweep.py. Shared rule "findings and
record updates go into the DATABASE, never into a markdown report" is the one
major rule enforced ONLY by a session remembering it at the moment of writing.

It failed twice in one sitting on 2026-08-03, in a session that had loaded the
rule and recited it back at session start. That is the same failure ledger-sweep
was built for, and its docstring already carries the finding: "The only control
that worked unassisted all night was a hook."

THE FOUR CAUSES, because a gate that treats only the symptom moves the leak:

  1. THE RULE'S OWN CARVE-OUT IS A TRAP. It ends "Narrative and doctrine files
     stay markdown; this rule is about RECORDS and FINDINGS." A handoff packet,
     a status writeup, an audit report and a checkpoint all LOOK like narrative
     and are made almost entirely of records: findings, decisions, open items.
     The rule as written permits the reading that broke it.
  2. NOTHING DETECTS IT. Write and Edit on a .md are completely unguarded. A
     wrong DB write throws; a wrong markdown write succeeds silently and reaches
     nobody — no query finds it, no export renders it, the other partner's
     sessions never see it. Silent success is the worst possible failure shape.
  3. A SKILL MANDATES IT. Both /handoff skills exist to produce "a drop-in
     markdown packet" and file it into CARR. The system instructs sessions to do
     the thing. That contradiction is tracked separately and is not this file's
     job, but no gate fixes a workflow that tells sessions to break the rule.
  4. FRICTION ASYMMETRY. Write always works. A verb needs a schema load, a fresh
     UUID and a base_version read. Under time pressure the cheap path wins, which
     is a design fact about the tooling, not a character fact about the session.

This file addresses cause 2 only, and only cause 2. That is honest scoping, not
a claim to have solved the problem.

WHAT IT DENIES, and every rule here is PATH-STRUCTURAL rather than content-
sniffing, on purpose. lint-gate.py's own doctrine says a gate that fires on
everything is a gate people learn to ignore, and a content heuristic on prose
this varied would misfire constantly and burn the gate's credibility in a day.

  A. ANY write or edit to a GENERATED RENDER. Already a hard rule with no
     mechanism until now. Pure path match, zero ambiguity, zero false positives.
  B. CREATING A NEW .md under 00_Context/, the vault ROOT, or out/. New-file
     creation is the tell: narrative and doctrine files already EXIST and get
     edited, while records arrive as brand-new files. This is the exact shape of
     every instance of the defect on record, including the cloud session that
     hand-wrote a DECISIONS.md duplicating what add-loop already does.
  C. ANY write or edit under 00_Context/handoffs/. A handoff is the purest form
     of records wearing narrative clothing, and it is the shape that failed on
     2026-08-03. The record layer already has the receiving end: catch-me-up and
     today-triage brief a new session from the DB, with no file to point at.
  D. Content carrying a RULE UUID next to a rule verb (teach/activate/retire/
     amend/supersede). That combination is never narrative — it is a record. This
     is the one content check, kept deliberately narrow.

PHASE 0 UPGRADE (2026-08-07, doctrine-store build — council decision 82a2fb62,
rules 14181e60 + 20dfdfcc): the per-class rules B (new .md in 00_Context/root)
and C (handoffs) are SUPERSEDED by vault-wide DENY BY DEFAULT on every .md
write, create and edit alike, governed by the exact-path manifest in
hooks/md_manifest.py. The old known-limit paragraph ("a session determined to
write records into an EXISTING narrative file under DNA/ can still do it") is
CLOSED — that was the residual hole Joe's database-first ruling eliminated.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. Anything outside the CARR vault: the repo (git-owned),
scratchpads (the ungoverned annex), Life AI, and the ~/.claude / My Drive/.claude
skill trees (harness-required; repo-canonical from P6). Non-markdown files,
except generated renders which are denied at any extension.

FAILS CLOSED ON DENY, OPEN ON ERROR. Exit 2 + stderr is the deny path, matching
guard-unattended.py and for the same reason: the structured JSON contract needs
exit 0, so on any build that does not parse it, exit 0 reads as ALLOW and the
gate fails open silently. Any INTERNAL error allows the call, because a gate that
wedges a session costs more than the marginal safety of failing closed on a
single-operator machine.

# unguarded — including all 23 client dossiers, which is exactly where the sweep's
# worst finding points (four live doctrine files tell sessions to type deal
# updates into those dossiers, and the export rewrites them several times a day,

#
# A duplicated list is the same two-homes disease this whole system is built to
# avoid, one layer down. So the set is PARSED from targets.py at call time —
# statically, via ast, with no import and no dependency, because the hook runs
# under /usr/bin/env python3 rather than the repo venv and must not need it.
#
# TWO THINGS THE FLAT DIFF GOT WRONG, and both matter:
#
#   * CLAUDE.md is a PARTIAL target. Only the block between the rule-gist-index

#     often. Denying the whole file would block real work, and partial.py already
#     fails loudly on missing or mangled markers, so a bad edit is caught at
#     export time. Partial targets are EXCLUDED from the deny set on purpose.
#   * The dossiers are a DIRECTORY (DOSSIER_DIR), not a fixed list. Guarding the
#     directory covers the 23 that exist and every one minted later; enumerating
#     them would reopen the same gap the day a new client lands.
