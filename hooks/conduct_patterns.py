"""conduct_patterns.py — the SHARED classifier for conduct gates.

ONE HOME for the offload / soft-wait / command-handoff patterns and for the
exemption tests, imported by BOTH gates that need them:

    hooks/conduct-stop-gate.py   Stop      catches it in free prose
    hooks/escalation-gate.py     PreToolUse catches it as an AskUserQuestion

They are two moments on the same behaviour, so they must not carry two copies
of the rule (consolidation bias, rule d367188d; single source of truth, rule
0f38532e). A second copy is how hooks/SETTINGS-BLOCK.md silently drifted to
describing two hooks while four were live.

Underscored filename ON PURPOSE: `conduct-stop-gate.py` is not importable
(hyphens), so the shared half lives here where both can `import conduct_patterns`.

Full rationale for each pattern class, the verification log for blocking Stop,
and the escape-hatch design are documented in conduct-stop-gate.py's docstring.
Fixtures: ops/conduct-gate-selftest.py.

# (4) BARE ID — an identifier put in front of a human with nothing saying what
# it is. Joe, 2026-08-09: "you name A17 and i have no idea what it even is. its
# unnecesarily confusing and vague", then: "make a hook that any time you
# reference a rule, hook, id number, or any type of ID in the system - you must
# list what it does."
#
# The ids exist so a rule can be reworded without breaking references to it — a
# real reason, and entirely a MACHINE's reason. A partner reading "rule 9530fb1c
# binds here" has been handed a lookup task instead of a sentence.
#
# THE TEST IS PROXIMITY, NOT PRESENCE, and that distinction is the design.
# Citing an id is fine when the sentence already says what the thing does; the
# NAKED id is the failure. Each match is checked for explanatory language within
# ~90 characters either side:
#     PASSES  "the audience gate — Joe decides client-facing, the system decides
#              internal (aa411351)"
#     CAUGHT  "per rule aa411351" · "A17 is still open" · "see decision ceb792f2"
# A presence-only check would ban ids outright, breaking the case where Joe
# genuinely needs one to run a verb.
