"""corpus_renders.py — the deny set for CORPUS RENDERS: files git owns and the
Drive/home copies merely display.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe, 2026-08-10, after the nightly chain failed on it:
"create a hook that prevents anything on me or dells side from writing to the
drive files ever again."

THE INCIDENT IT CLOSES. On 2026-08-09 the chair-verdict-bars work was written
into the DRIVE copies of eight council files. Git has been canonical for the
doctrine corpus since 2026-08-06, so those edits landed on renders. Nothing
stopped them and nothing noticed until the nightly corpus push refused to
overwrite them the next morning and exited 2. Nothing was lost that time — the
push refuses rather than clobbering, which is the one thing standing between
this failure and silent data loss. Rely on that twice and the second time is a
`--push` running before anyone reads the conflict.

The cost was not the eight files. It was that the chain went red for a reason
nobody could distinguish from the mypy tripwire that had already been red for
three days, so the chain's exit code stopped carrying information.

WHY record-home-gate DIDN'T ALREADY COVER IT, and this is the interesting part.
That gate's docstring names the `~/.claude` and `My Drive/.claude` trees as
explicitly out of scope: "harness-required; repo-canonical from P6." The word
doing the work is repo-canonical — the reasoning was that because git owns
them, something else governs them. Nothing did. An exclusion justified by
another control's existence is only as good as that control, and here the other
control was an assumption.

WHAT IT DENIES — TWO PROJECTIONS, because the Drive tree has two owners and a
file is worth protecting regardless of which tool writes it:
  * every `source` in corpus/manifest.json — `vault:` doctrine under CARR AI and
    `home:` portable meta-skills under ~/.claude, written by corpus-sync.py
  * every file under claude-tree/{skills,agents}, projected onto
    My Drive/.claude by bin/sync-skills.sh

THE SECOND ONE WAS ADDED 2026-08-10 WITH THE TWO-OWNERS RULING (loop #312), and
the reason is worth stating. Those 24 files were originally in the corpus set, so
this module covered them for free. The ruling moved ownership to claude-tree/ and
took them OUT of the set — which would have silently removed the write-block from
exactly the files whose loss started the investigation. Protection follows the
FILE, never the tool that happens to own it this week.

NEITHER LIST IS RETYPED. One is read from the manifest, the other walked from the
directory. Same discipline as record-home-gate parsing exporters/targets.py: a
duplicated list is the two-homes disease one layer down, and it goes stale on the
first file anyone adds.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. Anything not in the manifest. The repo's own
corpus/ copies — those are the canonical originals and editing them is the
CORRECT path this gate steers people toward. Scratchpads, Life AI, non-corpus
files anywhere.

DELL'S SIDE. The gate resolves its roots from `CARR_VAULT` when set and falls
back to a glob over `~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-*/My Drive/CARR AI`, so
it binds on his machine the moment he pulls, with no per-machine edit. His
settings already carry the two hooks this module plugs into.

FAILS OPEN ON ERROR, by deliberate inheritance from the other gates: a gate that
wedges a session costs more than the marginal safety of failing closed on a
single-operator machine. A parse failure logs and allows.
