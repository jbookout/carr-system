"""session-brief.py — the ZERO-FILE local bootstrap (Joe, 2026-08-08:
"Couldn't that claude Md file just become the project instructions? And then
we truly don't have any Md files").

SessionStart hook for sessions rooted in the CARR vault: stdout injects the
briefing directive that CLAUDE.md used to carry, built FRESH from the store
each session — so unlike the file, it cannot go stale (the file lagged its
own rule counts by 4 within a day of the last refresh; measured 2026-08-08).

Three layers of the same directive, by surface:
  - MCP server `instructions` field  → every connector-holding session, all
    surfaces, Dell included (mcp.js)
  - Cowork project-instructions FIELD → the rev-7 pointer stub (no file)
  - THIS HOOK                         → local Claude Code, code not markdown

FAIL-SOFT IS A STOP RAIL, NOT SILENCE: if the store is unreachable the hook
still injects the identity line and the stop-and-say-so instruction — a blank
session that improvises files is the failure this whole build exists to end.

    # then it's not adequate."

    # He is right, and the session that heard it was the proof: it opened by
    # reciting 164 rule counts and then violated at least three of them —
    # handing him a shell command to paste, and putting bare identifiers in
    # front of him twice — each caught AFTER the fact by a Stop hook rather
    # than by having read the rule. The recitation was a count, not
    # comprehension.

    exact operation git-writer-gate.py was built to block on 2026-08-09, after a
    sweep took another session's in-flight files and cost an hour of rebuilding.
    A timer cannot tell whose file is whose, cannot tell finished work from a
    half-applied edit, and would replace the commit message with 'auto-commit'.

    rig applies tools/dictation-rig/patches/*.patch on every build, so quill is
    permanently modified by design and was being announced nightly as somebody's
    lost edit. A moved gitlink COMMIT is still real uncommitted work and is
    still reported; only work-tree dirt is ignored. (2) `_newest_mtime`: a
    gitlink path is a DIRECTORY, and a directory's mtime does not move when a
    file nested inside it changes, so getmtime() on one returns the date the
    submodule was first checked out and the age only ever climbs. That reported
