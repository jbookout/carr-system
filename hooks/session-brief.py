"""session-brief.py — the ZERO-FILE local bootstrap (Joe, 2026-08-08:
"Couldn't that claude Md file just become the project instructions? And then
we truly don't have any Md files").

SessionStart hook for sessions rooted in the CARR vault: stdout injects the
briefing directive that CLAUDE.md used to carry, built FRESH from the store
each session — so unlike the file, it cannot go stale (the file lagged its
own rule counts by 4 within a day of the last refresh; measured 2026-08-08).

Three layers of the same directive, by surface:
  - MCP server `instructions` field  → every connector-holding session, all
    surfaces, Dell included (mcp.js)
  - Cowork project-instructions FIELD → the rev-7 pointer stub (no file)
  - THIS HOOK                         → local Claude Code, code not markdown

FAIL-SOFT IS A STOP RAIL, NOT SILENCE: if the store is unreachable the hook
still injects the identity line and the stop-and-say-so instruction — a blank
session that improvises files is the failure this whole build exists to end.
"""
# PEP 604 annotations (`str | None`) are evaluated at def time before

    # front of him twice — each caught AFTER the fact by a Stop hook rather
    # than by having read the rule. The recitation was a count, not
