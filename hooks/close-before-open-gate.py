"""close-before-open-gate.py — the side-quest brake.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The session brief says CLOSE-BEFORE-OPEN, but a session that
does not read the brief can still start a side quest by creating a new file
under design/, phase0/, control-room/contracts/, or a roadmap/build-plan/
action-plan path. This PreToolUse gate blocks that write when open work
exists — the same open classification session-brief.py computes.

GENERALIZED 2026-08-21. The opslang state machine has three stages:

  CONCEPTUAL:     captured → triaged → ready
  IMPLEMENTATION: claimed → in_progress → verification
  CONSTRUCTION:   verification → awaiting_release → released → confirmed_closed

A session must name its STAGE and its WORK REQUEST. If it cannot, it is a side
quest and must stop or file, not build. This gate blocks new conceptual
artifacts when any of these are open:
  - built-unclosed: code on disk, not confirmed_closed
  - implementation-open: claimed/in_progress/verification

WHAT IT DENIES, when open work exists:
  - a NEW file under design/, phase0/, control-room/contracts/
  - a NEW *roadmap* / *build-plan* / *action-plan* path (any directory)

WHAT IT DOES NOT BLOCK:
  - edits to existing evidence/test/hook files that implement THIS latch
  - bugfixes under ops/, hooks/, mcp-server/ for this branch
  - commits / tests
  - the Edit tool on an existing file (creation is the tell, not editing)
  - Bash (not this gate's lane)

FAIL OPEN ON ERROR, CLOSED ONLY ON A REAL MATCH — same convention as
record-home-gate.py and bash-write-gate.py: a gate that wedges a session
costs more than the marginal safety of failing closed on a single-operator
machine.

Run: wired as a PreToolUse hook in .claude/settings.json and
ops/config/codex-hooks.json.
