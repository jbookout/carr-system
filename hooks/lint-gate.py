"""lint-gate.py — the PostToolUse writing-lint gate (idea-bank #32, job b).

WHY. `run.sh lint` is a gate in doctrine and a habit in practice: it only fires
when someone remembers it. `DNA/writing-rules.md` binds EVERY surface a prospect
could ever see, and the expensive failures are the ones that ship. This makes the
gate mechanical for the one moment that matters, the write itself.

WHAT IT DOES. After a Write or Edit lands on a plausibly client-facing vault file,
it runs the linter and puts the result back in front of the session. It NEVER
blocks: the linter's own doctrine is that HARD is blocked and REVIEW must be
cleared consciously, and "consciously" means a human or the session deciding, not
a regex. A clean lint run is also explicitly NOT the writing-audit; that judgment
pass still belongs to the audit skill, and the output says so.

SCOPE, deliberately narrow. Only the CARR vault, only surfaces a prospect could
see. Repo code, scratchpad files, generated renders and internal ledgers are
skipped, because a linter that fires on everything is a linter people learn to
ignore. Generated files are skipped for a second reason: they are never
hand-edited, so linting them would only ever report the exporter's output.

FAILS OPEN AND SILENT. Any error, missing linter, or timeout exits 0 with no
output. This is an advisory gate on top of an existing doctrine, and it must
never be the reason a write appears to fail.

# INTERNAL BY CONSTRUCTION — never linted, checked BEFORE the surface map.
#
# Added 2026-08-03. `("Deal Management", "proposal")` below is a broad fragment
# and it swallowed `DNA/Deal Management/record-layer/`, which is the ENGINEERING
# folder: work orders, design memos, onboarding runbooks. Those got the full
# prospect-facing ruleset, so a MARKETING rule enforcing solo-Joe framing fired
# on `dell-onboarding-runbook`, a document whose entire subject is Dell, and a
# style rule about colons fired on a spec. Six "hard ban" hits on a file no
# prospect will ever see.
#
# Rule ede4c735 is explicit that writing-rules binds PROSPECT-VISIBLE SURFACES
# ONLY, so this is not a relaxation — the gate was overreaching its own charter.
# The cost of overreach is not noise, it is that a human learns the alarm is
# usually wrong and starts clicking past it, and then it catches nothing on the
# day it is right. That is the same failure the façade check (rule 28) names for
# health checks reporting everything at one severity.

# that could plausibly reach a prospect keeps its surface, because a false
# NEGATIVE here is far worse than a false positive.
