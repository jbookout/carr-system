"""blocker-decider-gate.py — a capability blocker names its decider, or it
does not file (rule 88e9b5eb).

'NOT AUTHORIZED' AND 'NOT POSSIBLE' ARE DIFFERENT FINDINGS, and a loop row
that says blocker='capability' without saying which one it is hides exactly
the fact its reader needs. If someone COULD grant the credential, gate, or
verb, the row must name that person — in this system that is Joe or Dell —
because a grant nobody is asked for never arrives, and the loop rots as
"blocked" while the decider it is waiting on does not know it exists. If
NOBODY can grant it (the plan lacks the API, the surface has no such control),
the row must say so plainly, so it reads as a limit to design around rather
than a request to wait on.

So on add-loop with blocker='capability', the row's own text must carry one
of the two resolutions:

    a named decider    — Joe or Dell appears in the row's text
    a stated limit     — the text says it is impossible/cannot be granted,
                         rather than merely unauthorized

Everything else — other blocker classes, other verbs, malformed payloads —
passes untouched, and any internal error FAILS OPEN: a wedged filing is worse
than a vague one, and the deferral gate server-side still enforces the rest
of the row's shape.

PreToolUse deny (exit 2), same contract as escalation-gate.py beside it.
