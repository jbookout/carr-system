"""hook-meter-run.py — runs a gate, times it, records what happened, decides nothing.

    /usr/bin/env python3 hooks/hook-meter-run.py hooks/guard-unattended.py [args...]

WHY IN-PROCESS AND NOT A SECOND PROCESS. The thing being measured is process
count: 13 hook invocations per Bash tool call, 11 Stop hooks per turn, on a
16GB machine that also runs the agents, where `python3 -c pass` costs 35ms at
best and 75ms at the median. A wrapper that spawned the gate as a child would
double the number it exists to measure and would cost more than everything else
in this file combined. So the gate is executed inside the wrapper's own
interpreter — compiled and exec'd under __main__, with its own argv, its own
stdin bytes and its own __file__ — which is what `python3 gate.py` does anyway,
since a script run as __main__ is never loaded from a .pyc cache either way.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT IMPORTED, because that is the entire performance budget. On
this machine, measured with -X importtime: `traceback` costs ~30ms (it reaches
linecache and tokenize), `re` ~12ms, `json` ~4ms, `runpy` ~2ms. Importing that
set before the gate would have made the measurement instrument cost a third of
the thing it measures. So above the gate there is `sys`, `os`, `io` and `time` —
all resident before this file is read — and nothing else. `traceback` is
imported inside the crash handler, `json` after the gate has finished (by which
point the gate has almost always imported it already, making it free), and `re`
never: the one marker this file looks for is found with str.find. Measured cost
of the wrapper itself is 0.7–1.0ms against a 38–65ms floor for a single hook,
and it is recorded on every line as meter_ms so the claim stays checkable
instead of becoming folklore.

THE ONE INVARIANT: THE DECISION IS UNTOUCHED.
  · exit code — SystemExit is caught and re-raised as the same code; a gate
    that returns without exiting exits 0; an escaping exception prints its
    traceback to stderr and exits 1, which is what a bare `python3 gate.py`
    would have done. The traceback text carries two extra wrapper frames at the
    top; the exception and its own frames are unchanged.
  · stdout / stderr — written through to the real streams as they are produced.
    The copy kept for classification is a side effect, never a substitute, and
    it is bounded so a chatty gate cannot make the meter the memory problem.
  · stdin — read once here and handed to the gate as a fresh TextIOWrapper over
    the same bytes, so a gate reading sys.stdin, sys.stdin.buffer or
    json.load(sys.stdin) sees exactly what it saw before.
  · the gate's own exceptions — never swallowed. Everything the METER does is
    wrapped; nothing the GATE does is.

AND THE MEASUREMENT IS NEVER LOAD-BEARING. hook_meter is imported inside a
try, and every use of it is guarded, because the alternative was proven bad on
2026-08-23 while this was being built: with a bare import, deleting or breaking
hook_meter.py made a gate die at import and exit 1 — which for guard-unattended
means a refusal silently stops happening. So the two things that WOULD change a
verdict if they failed — replacing stdin, and passing output through — are done
here with `io` alone and depend on nothing. If hook_meter is gone, this file
still runs the gate correctly and simply records nothing. Being unable to
measure is never a reason to change a verdict.

WHAT ONE LINE HOLDS: event, hook, live|fixture|unclassified, elapsed_ms
(monotonic, the gate only), meter_ms, allow|deny|ask|error, exit code, whether a
Stop gate reopened the turn, and a deny class where the gate exposes one — plus
the first line of its refusal, which is the class every gate here already has in
practice even though none of them declares one yet.

AND THE CORRELATION KEYS, which are what let a reader ask about the tool CALL
rather than about one gate: `tool_use_id` is identical across every hook that
fires for one invocation, so the rollup can total exactly what that Bash call
paid and name the gate that actually sentenced it. `prompt_id` does the same for
Stop, which has no tool call, so a turn reopened three times reads as one turn
reopened three times.

REOPENS ARE THE EXPENSIVE EVENT, and that is grok's flag from the 2026-08-23
council: a Stop gate that blocks does not merely cost 15ms of Python, it hands
the turn back to the model and spends LLM tokens. The standing constraint is
that nothing may increase token usage in steady state — so an enforcement stack
that reopens turns on false positives is that constraint being violated by the
thing enforcing it. Reopens are therefore counted per gate per day rather than
folded into a deny total.

      "reopen"    the gate BLOCKED. exit 2, or {"decision":"block"}. On Stop
                  that hands the turn back to the model and costs a whole
                  extra assistant message.
      "announce"  the gate spoke without blocking — it returned
                  hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext, which reaches the model
                  as context inside the turn it already paid for. Costs nothing

    loose-work and unread-artifact — were demoted on 2026-08-23 from blocking to
    announcing. A0c deliberately restores context-handoff as the fourth admitted
    reopener at a measured lifecycle threshold; the other four still announce
    and charge nothing. A reader inferring from the exit code sees exit 0 and
    records "allow" for those announcements, which is true about the DECISION
    and silent about the INTERVENTION, so four gates doing real work would look
    like four gates that had gone quiet — and the retire rule keys on denies, so
    each would drift toward being a candidate for precisely the reason it is
    working.

    It also settles a misreading already in the record: the council brief counted
    "eight chat-lint reopens" when chat-lint has not blocked since 2026-08-16 —
    it parks a note for the next UserPromptSubmit instead. A ledger that cannot
