"""loose-work-gate.py — a session does not end leaving its OWN work uncommitted.

WHY (Joe, 2026-08-14): "why the fuck am i having to tell every session to commit
its work? this is insane."

He was right, and the reason was structural rather than anyone being lazy.

DETECTION ALREADY EXISTED AND WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE. tools/health-check.py
reports loose tracked files — but it runs in the nightly chain, once a day, into
a report somebody has to read, long after the session that left the work has
ended. Five hooks already run at Stop (conduct, completion-evidence, ledger-sweep,
context-handoff, scheduled-run-record) and every one of them checks what a session
SAYS. Nothing checked what it LEFT. So the fastest detector on the machine was
Joe noticing, which is the one detector whose time is worth anything.

ONLY THIS SESSION'S FILES, and that limit is the whole design. Several sessions
share one working tree; on the day this was written it held three loose files
belonging to three different sessions. A gate that flagged all of them would make
every session responsible for the whole tree — which is how a nine-session
broadcast happened on this machine, and is strictly worse than the problem it
would be solving. The transcript already records what THIS session wrote, and
nothing else is its business.

REUSES THE TWO HELPERS THAT ALREADY DO THIS. delegation-gate.written_path()
extracts the target of a Write/Edit/apply_patch call, and ledger-sweep.read_tail()
walks a transcript. Neither is copied here: a second implementation of either
would drift from the original and be wrong in a different way (rule a8c55a47).

WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a security control and not a commit policy — it does not care
what you commit, only that you do not walk away from your own edits. It fails
open on every broken input, because a Stop hook that strands sessions is worse
than the thing it checks for.
