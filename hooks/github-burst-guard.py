"""github-burst-guard.py — refuse Bash commands that burst the shared GitHub account.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-10-06 one session ran a shell loop that made about 55
`gh` calls within seconds, then ran `ops/release-pipeline.py tick` by hand three
times in five minutes. GitHub's short-window (secondary) rate limit answered
403 for the whole account, which every session, CI watcher, review loop and the
release pipeline share, and an urgent production release stopped behind the
lockout. Joe ordered a rule (74ddb23c, "never burst GitHub") and enforcement;
this hook is the enforcement.

WHAT IT REFUSES (PreToolUse, Bash and the Codex exec shapes):
  1. A shell loop — for / while / until, or xargs / parallel — that runs `gh`
     with no `sleep N` (N >= 2) inside it. Allowed: the same loop with that
     sleep, which covers the `until gh ...; do sleep 30; done` poll; and a
     `for` over a short literal list (items x gh calls per pass <= 10). Ten
     calls cannot trip the short-window limit, and checking a handful of
     named PRs this way is routine: replaying recorded Bash commands showed
     most loop refusals under a three-item cap were exactly that.
  2. A release-pipeline tick (ops/release-pipeline*.py tick, any path or copy)
     or out/orch/shepherd.sh started within five minutes of the last one this
     hook saw start. One shared window: shepherd ticks the pipeline itself.
  3. During a fifteen-minute cooldown after a recorded GitHub rate-limit answer:
     every gh call and the release tick, except `gh api rate_limit`.
  4. Two or more gh calls where one is sent to the background with a single
     `&` (`gh a & gh b`): they run at the same time, which is a parallel burst.
     One backgrounded gh on its own, and `;` / `&&` / `||` chains, which run
     one call at a time, are allowed.

WHAT IT RECORDS (PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure, same file): the time of a
GitHub rate-limit answer, which starts the cooldown. The command must touch
GitHub (gh, the release tick, shepherd, api.github.com), and then either:
  a. it FAILED (a PostToolUseFailure event, or a non-zero exit code in the
     payload) and "API rate limit exceeded" or "secondary rate limit" sits on
     gh's own error line, one carrying `HTTP 403` / `HTTP 429` or starting
     `gh:` or `GraphQL:`; or
  b. whatever the exit code (a piped `gh ... | head` exits 0), a line starts
     at column 0 with `HTTP 403:`, `HTTP 429:`, `gh:` or `GraphQL:` and holds
     the phrase. Diff lines (+/-) and indented PR-body lines do not qualify.
A `gh pr diff`, PR body or run log that merely mentions the phrase therefore
records nothing, and neither does reading this file.

ALWAYS ALLOWED outside the cooldown, when not inside a loop: a single gh
command, gh --paginate, and gh api graphql. One paginated call is the cheap
alternative the refusals name. Text the shell will not run (a heredoc body, a
commit message, a --body or grep pattern in quotes) is not scanned for gh.

STATE: out/github-burst-guard-state.json (out/ is git-ignored), shared by every
session on the machine because the limit is per account, not per session.
CARR_GITHUB_BURST_STATE overrides the path for the selftest.

KNOWN LIMIT. It sees the command a session issues, not what a script does
inside itself, and a loop hidden behind a variable or a script file is not
visible. The threat model is the 2026-10-06 shape: a session typing the burst.

FAILS OPEN. An internal error, malformed input or an unreadable state file
allows the call and logs the reason to out/hook-guard.log.
