"""settings-change-gate.py — a settings change records itself, and is announced.

WR-000019 SLICE S3 (2026-08-27). The PreToolUse half used to REFUSE a settings
write that carried no stated reason (see THE INCIDENT below for why). It no
longer does: it ANNOUNCES instead, and the reason it asked for moved to the
PR-description convention that now governs every enforcement-code and
settings change — CODEOWNERS auto-requests Joe on a PR touching hooks/ or
ops/config/, and the PR-only ruleset with required CI is what actually keeps
main honest. An inline `CARR_CHANGE_REASON="..."` is still the fastest way to
carry a reason all the way to the record layer in one step, and is still read
the same way; it is simply no longer mandatory to proceed. Rollback: revert
this PR, which restores the PreToolUse refusal.

THE INCIDENT, 2026-08-14, THAT ORIGINALLY MOTIVATED THE REFUSAL. A session was
commissioned to fix main's merge treadmill. Its instructions said, in Joe's own
words, "this likely changes repo settings, so present the finished
configuration to Joe with what changed and why." It chose a remedy Joe had
listed himself, turned off the branch ruleset's "require branches to be up to
date" flag — and was INTERRUPTED before it delivered the report.

The change reached the repository. The reason reached nothing: no commit, no
loop, no decision entry. Eight hours later a different session found the setting
missing, could not distinguish an authorised change from silent tampering, and
rebuilt authorship out of ruleset version history, a shell-history timestamp and
a transcript search. The change was correct the whole time. Nobody could tell.

THE CRUX, and it is NOT "sessions should write things down". That session was
told to write it down and would have. The record died because it depended on the
session SURVIVING TO THE END — and a session is the least durable thing in this
system. It can be interrupted, compacted, or closed mid-sentence.

So the record is taken by the same mechanism that performs the change, at the
moment it performs it. Prose asks; this takes.

HOW IT WORKS, two halves of one gate:
  PreToolUse   a settings write with no stated reason is ANNOUNCED — allowed,
               with a nudge toward the inline reason and the PR-description
               convention printed alongside it.
  PostToolUse  the change is recorded WITH ITS OUTCOME, because a change that
               failed and a change that landed are different facts and only the
               post hook knows which happened.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.

It never blocks on the recorder. If the record layer is unreachable the change
still stands and the row spools locally. A gate that can strand a partner
mid-incident because a database is down gets removed within a week, and should
be — the failure it prevents is silence, not urgency.

It never stores a secret VALUE. `gh secret set NEON_API_KEY` records that the
secret was set and which one; the value never appears on the command line in the
first place, and the recorded command is the invocation, not its stdin.

It does not fire on reads. A gate that trips on `gh api` GET or `git config
--get` gets muted within a day, and then it protects nothing.
