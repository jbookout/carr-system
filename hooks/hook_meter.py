"""hook_meter.py — one structured line per hook firing, and the live/fixture split.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-08-23 process-audit council was asked where the line
is at which enforcement costs more than the defects it prevents, and could not
answer from the evidence this system had. out/hook-guard.log held 182,715 lines
over 9 days — 134,595 of them DENY — but every gate's selftest fires the same
gate with attack fixtures and writes to the SAME file, so the DENY count is an
upper bound on real friction mixed with an unknown volume of test traffic. Grok,
in the transcript: "That log is not a measurement." Codex: "Until [fixture and
operational logs are separated], the 134,595 DENY events are not an enforcement
metric." Both chairs marked measuring safe and marked the consolidation it would
justify (one dispatcher process per event instead of 13 interpreter launches per
Bash call) needs-design UNTIL this data exists. This module is that measurement.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and this is the whole constraint: it never participates in
a decision. It records elapsed time, an outcome the caller already reached, and
which log a line belongs in. Every function here returns a value or swallows its
own exception; none of them can deny, allow, delay past a few hundred
microseconds, or raise into a gate's control flow. If this file were deleted
mid-run every gate would still reach the same verdict.

THE LIVE / FIXTURE / UNCLASSIFIED SPLIT, and why the default is not "live".
Attribution comes from the environment, because the environment is the only
thing that knows:

  CARR_HOOK_LIVE=1      set by hooks/hook-meter-run.py, which the harness — and
                        only the harness — invokes with a real event payload.
  CARR_HOOK_FIXTURE=1   set by a selftest, by ops/ci.sh's gates class, or by
                        anything else deliberately firing a gate at a fixture.
                        PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST counts as the same signal.
  neither               UNCLASSIFIED. Not "live", not "fixture" — a third
                        stream.

Defaulting an unmarked run to "live" is how the current log got into this state:
one unattributed source silently inflates the number the decision rests on.
Defaulting it to "fixture" would be the same mistake pointed the other way — it
would quietly DELETE operational evidence, which matters here because a gate
fired through some door that is not the wrapper (a stale settings.json, the
Codex adapter in ops/config/codex-hooks.json, a hand-run gate during an
incident) is exactly the case where somebody is reading the log for real. So
unmarked traffic goes to its own file and the rollup prints its volume. If that
number is large, the wiring is wrong and it says so instead of averaging in.
