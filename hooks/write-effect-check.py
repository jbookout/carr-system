"""write-effect-check.py — what CHANGED, rather than what was intended.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the lesson of 2026-08-14 rather than a new idea. Every
write control in this system parses INTENT: record-home-gate.py reads a tool's
file_path, bash-write-gate.py extracts targets out of a shell command. That is
the only thing a PreToolUse hook CAN do, and it cannot be complete against
arbitrary shell. On the day bash-write-gate shipped it produced two false
refusals of real work in one afternoon — an unexpanded `$D` judged as literal
text, and a path merely MENTIONED beside an unrelated write — and both came from
the gate answering a question it could not answer instead of declining.

This asks a question that has an answer. Not "what is this command going to
write" but "what actually changed on disk". That is COMPLETE with respect to how
a write happened: a heredoc, an interpreter nothing knows about, a script invoked
by name that writes on its own, a path assembled from variables at runtime — none
of them can hide from the filesystem. It closes the residual named in
bash-write-gate's docstring, from the other side.

HOW IT WORKS. PreToolUse on Bash stamps a marker with the time. PostToolUse
sweeps for watched files modified since that stamp and asks the EXISTING
record-home policy about each. No new judgement lives here, same as
bash-write-gate: one policy, more doors.

WHAT IT WATCHES, and this scoping is what makes it quiet enough to keep. Only
vault markdown the policy says NOTHING may write — 564 of 620 files at the time
of writing, against 44 generated renders and 12 machine-required exemptions.
RENDERS ARE DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED. The exporter writes them several times a day,
frequently from launchd while a session's Bash command is in flight, and effects
alone cannot distinguish the exporter's write from a session's. Watching only
files with no legitimate writer at all means no allowlist is needed and the
hourly refresh cannot generate a single false report. An allowlist of sanctioned
writer commands was the alternative, and it was rejected because it would have
smuggled intent-parsing back in through the door this check exists to avoid.

WHAT IT IS NOT, said plainly so nobody reads more into it. IT CANNOT PREVENT. The
write has already landed when this runs; the tool contract offers nothing else at
this layer. It reports. Prevention at this completeness needs enforcement in the
filesystem or in the record layer, which is a larger build and a separate
decision. What it closes is the SILENT failure — a write landing where no query
finds it and nobody ever learns it happened, which is the shape Joe called "the
worst mistake that can be made in this database system".

DIRECTION OF ERROR, chosen deliberately after today: this is a detector, so its
worst failure is noise, not blocked work. That is the right way round for a first
version and the exact opposite of what bash-write-gate got wrong twice.

COST: about 1ms on the pre pass (a timestamp) and about 8ms on the post pass (a
scandir sweep with cached stats over ~620 files). Measured before building,
because the alternative — stat()ing every file twice — was 80ms per Bash call and
would have been the wrong design for a reason nobody would have noticed later.

FAILS OPEN ON EVERYTHING. It never blocks and never errors a session out.
