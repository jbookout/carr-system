"""model-floor-gate.py — stop a voice run that landed on too small a model.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Two daily runs draft in Joe's public voice and both carry a
HARD model floor taught by Joe himself: the X reply run (2026-07-20, after
Sonnet produced shallow keyword-matched drafts) and the LinkedIn engagement run
(2026-07-21, "comment quality is the whole point of the routine"). Both floors
were enforced the same way: prose telling the run to "check your own model" and
stop if it is Sonnet.

THAT SELF-CHECK IS THE WEAK LINK, and not for the obvious reason. It is not
that a run would defy the instruction; it is that asking a model to introspect
its own identity is asking the least reliable component in the system for the
one fact the gate depends on. The harness KNOWS the answer and writes it down.
So the run should be TOLD, not asked.

WHERE IT CAN AND CANNOT BITE, stated plainly because it shaped the design.
Neither run publishes anything. The X run says "Claude never posts a reply,
ever"; the LinkedIn run says "You never post, comment, like, connect, or
follow." Both draft and hand the shortlist to Joe in chat. So unlike the
executor-tier gate next door, there is NO publish call at the moment of harm to
intercept — the harmful artifact is chat text, which no hook sees. The only
enforceable moment is EARLY, before the drafting work happens, and the earliest
tool both runs reach for is the browser. That is where this sits. A run that
somehow drafted without touching a tool would slip past, and that is an honest
limit of the mechanism rather than something papered over.

HOW IT KNOWS THE MODEL. The PreToolUse payload does NOT carry one. Verified
against the payload-construction code in the installed binary: a tool hook
receives session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt_id, permission_mode,
agent_id, agent_type and effort, and `effort` is a derived reasoning tier, not
a model identity. But transcript_path IS handed over, and every assistant
record in that JSONL carries `message.model` as a plain string written by the
harness. Tail the transcript, read the newest one. That is the fact the prose
self-check was guessing at.

HOW IT KNOWS WHICH RUN. The floors are per-run, so a general session must not
be gated. The opening user message of a scheduled run carries the task name, so
the head of the transcript is matched against the `match` strings in
ops/config/model-floors.json. A session that matches nothing is cached as
unbound in out/model-floor-cache/ and costs one small head read for the whole
session, not one per tool call.

FLOORS ARE DATA. Adding a third floor is an entry in the config, not an edit
here (rule 5e89c211).

FAILS OPEN on any error, like every gate here. A gate that crashes must never
be able to stop work. Logged to out/hook-guard.log.
