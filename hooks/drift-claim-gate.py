"""drift-claim-gate.py — before asserting something drifted, show the decision.

THE FAILURE CLASS THIS TARGETS is the most common one this system has:
"dated-artifact-read-as-present-state", running since 2026-08-04, with the
majority caught by a human rather than by the system. The shape is always the
same.

NO COUNT IS WRITTEN HERE, and that is a correction. This file carried "8
occurrences" in its docstring and in the message it prints; by 2026-08-15 the
ledger read twelve. A gate whose whole job is catching a stale figure quoted as
present state cannot quote a stale figure as present state in the sentence meant
to persuade — rule b01edd26 bans exactly that, and a session that spots the wrong
number has been handed a reason to discount everything after it. A PreToolUse
hook must stay fast and offline, so it cannot ask the record layer for the live
value; `standing-context` returns it to any session that wants the integer.
Fixed alongside hooks/drift-assertion-gate.py, which carried the identical
defect — the Stop door and this write door are one mechanism and drift together.
A session reads a CURRENT artifact that is perfectly accurate about the present
(a status line, a file's contents, a script's output, a count) and concludes
that something has drifted, regressed, or was never finished, without checking
whether the present state was CHOSEN.

THE INSTANCE THAT MOTIVATED THIS, 2026-08-13. A session read the gate-integrity
banner and harden-gates.sh reporting "0 hardened · 18 unprotected", concluded
the enforcement layer had silently regressed, filed a defect asserting a
completed loop had been closed without its work landing, and put a hot item in
front of Joe asking him to run the hardening. All wrong. Joe had authorized
that hardening on 2026-08-09, watched it work, and deliberately REVERSED it on
2026-08-10 because a buggy gate would then need his password to fix. The
reversal was recorded in decision-history the whole time. Two artifacts were
read; the one that explained them was not.

WHY A NAG WOULD NOT WORK. The failure classes are already surfaced at every
session start, including this one, and the session still failed. "Remember to
check" is the same prose that has failed repeatedly before. So this hook does
not remind anyone of anything: it RUNS THE SEARCH ITSELF and puts the matching
decisions in front of the session at the moment it is about to make the claim.

IT SPEAKS ONLY WHEN IT HAS SOMETHING TO SAY, which is the whole anti-alarm-
fatigue design. Two conditions must both hold: the text reads like a drift
claim, AND the decision history actually contains something about the subject.
A drift claim with no matching decision is probably a real finding and passes
in silence. That silence is deliberate: a gate that fires on everything gets
clicked past, and then it catches nothing at all (the same argument
rule-shape-gate.py makes).

IT NEVER DENIES. Real drift must always be filable. Blocking a defect filing
would break the one mechanism this system has for learning from its own errors.
It attaches context and gets out of the way.

FAILS OPEN on any error. Logged to out/hook-guard.log.
