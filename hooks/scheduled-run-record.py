"""scheduled-run-record.py — the Stop hook that closes Program 3's last gap:
"Job failure becomes a durable failed run, incident, or Work Request. It
cannot exist only in stdout or a local log." (roadmap line, quoted verbatim).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The ~17 Claude Code scheduled tasks on this Mac (loop-drain-
weekdays, restore-rehearse-weekly, the nightly-record-layer LAUNCH session,
...) are prompts executed by a Claude session the scheduler starts, not scripts
with an exit code. bin/nightly.sh's launchd-run STEPS already record
themselves to ops.run via record_run() (see lib/scheduled_run.py's docstring
for the full design). Nothing did the equivalent for a scheduled Claude session
itself — if one hit a permission gate, ran out of turns, or otherwise failed,
that fact lived only in the session transcript and in Joe's inbox notification,
never in the record layer, so it never became an incident and never showed up
in `ops-record.py health` the way every other automation on this Mac does.

HOW IT WORKS, all of it in lib/scheduled_run.py so the hook and the manual CLI
(bin/record-scheduled-run.py) are the same code (rule a8c55a47):
  1. Cheap check: does this transcript's first few lines carry the
     `<scheduled-task name="...">` launch marker? If not, this is an ordinary
     interactive session and the hook exits immediately — no file writes.
  2. If it does: read the transcript, work out succeeded/failed
     DETERMINISTICALLY (a PreToolUse gate DENY anywhere, or a trailing
     unrecovered tool error — see lib/scheduled_run.py), and record one
     ops.run row via tools/ops-record.py.

IDEMPOTENCY: exactly once per session, at the FIRST Stop. A scheduled session
that a human later continues interactively (observed in practice — a scheduled
run's transcript can keep growing for hours after its own turn ends) must NOT
re-record on every later turn of that same session; only the first Stop is the
scheduled task's own work, so the per-session cache short-circuits every Stop
after that.

NEVER BLOCKS. This hook only observes; it has no opinion on whether the turn
should continue, so it never emits a "block" decision and never denies
anything. It also never lets a recording failure become visible as a session
failure: if the DB credential is absent, ops-record.py's own refusal is logged
to out/hook-guard.log (see lib/scheduled_run.py's run_ops_record) and this
hook still exits 0. A scheduled task's own work is never blocked or altered by
whether its own outcome could be filed.

FAILS OPEN on any internal error, like every gate in this file's family.
