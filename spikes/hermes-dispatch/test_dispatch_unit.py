"""Unit proof for the Hermes dispatch desk. No live session, no model spend.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Joe, 2026-08-20: "i want you to build a bridge with hermes
so that hermes can dispatch to sessions in claude or codex ... hermes will
delegate to the appropriate model for each task i want to do." Hermes is the
router; this is the wire it routes over. Two desk kinds so far:

  claude-session  a LIVE labeled Claude Code session, addressed by its socket
  codex-session   a standing Codex thread, resumed by id so its context carries

THE REFUSAL THAT MAKES IT SAFE TO RUN ON JOE'S MAC. Every ordinary Claude Code
session binds /tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock, and Joe's real sessions sit in that
same directory. A pid names a process, not a desk, and a dispatcher that can
address a pid can walk into any window he has open. So a pid socket is refused
as a target — at registration AND again at resolve time, because the file can
be hand-edited between the two. A desk is a session deliberately started with
`claude --messaging-socket-path /tmp/cc-socks/<name>.sock`, which is a
statement of intent that a pid is not.

Run:  python3 spikes/hermes-dispatch/test_dispatch_unit.py
Exit 0 = every assertion held.
