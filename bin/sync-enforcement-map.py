"""sync-enforcement-map.py — keep the enforcement map's rule inventory in step
with the compiled-rules renders, so activating a rule can never again leave the
gates reporting themselves out of force.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Twice in two days (2026-08-12 and 2026-08-13) a rule was
activated, the compiled-rules renders picked it up on the hourly refresh, and
the enforcement map did not. The map's `active_rule_ids` must match the render
order exactly, so each time the parity checker failed, and every session that
booted afterwards was told all enforcing gates were not in force. On 2026-08-13
the covering commit even asserted "re-bless in the same commit" while touching
only one file, so the miss survived review.

`active_rule_ids` is DERIVED DATA: its only correct value is the render order.
Nothing is decided here, which is exactly why no model may be spent on it (Joe's
2026-08-13 council rule on never spending a cognition token on anything already
expressible as a tested predicate). This is that predicate.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never runs a full `gate-integrity.py
--bless`. A full bless re-hashes every gate SCRIPT, so an automated job calling
it would happily bless a tampered gate and destroy the detection the baseline
exists to provide. This script rewrites exactly one baseline entry — the
contract hash of the map file it just derived — and leaves all 20 gate-script
hashes frozen. Tampering with a gate is still detected on the next boot.

SKIP-not-FAIL, per house convention: a missing render or baseline is a SKIP at
exit 0, not a failure that would take the hourly refresh down with it.
