"""bin/outage-drill.py — the SYNTHETIC half of Program 4's degraded-mode
requirement: a repeatable drill harness that induces each survivable outage
against NON-PRODUCTION surfaces and asserts the system TELLS THE TRUTH rather
than showing green or fabricating a response.

THE DOCTRINE THIS PROVES, verbatim:
  "Dependency outage exercises prove truthful degraded behavior."
  "Unknown telemetry displays Unknown and can disable unsafe writes."
  "Unknown telemetry never displays Healthy."
  "Model outage makes Doc unavailable or deterministic/read-only; it never
   fabricates an AI response."
  "Database outage blocks authoritative writes and preserves safe local
   capture only when encrypted, clearly pending, and later reviewed."
Exit evidence: "tabletop or synthetic outage proves truthful UI, bounded
retries, reconciliation, and no duplicated effects."

THE OTHER HALF — a human tabletop with Joe unavailable and Dell using his own
real access — is filed separately and is NOT this file's job. This file only
does what a machine can do safely, on its own, repeatedly: point a real
component at an unreachable endpoint, an invalid credential, or a fixture, and
read back whether the system told the truth about it.

GROUND RULES, enforced by construction, not by promise:
  * NEVER a real outage on production. No production service is stopped, no
    real credential is revoked, nothing is deleted, and no write reaches the
    production database — every drill that needs a live database uses the
    ISOLATED STAGING NEON PROJECT (tools/db-tap.py --project staging), which
    shares no data or credentials with production (see db-tap.py's own
    PROJECTS comment). Every drill that needs a live Worker uses the staging
    Worker (carr-mcp-staging.joe-bookout-carr-us.workers.dev) or a local
    fixture. A drill that cannot be induced safely is reported as SKIPPED
    with the reason, never improvised around.
  * Outages are induced by pointing a component at an unreachable endpoint
    (postgresql://127.0.0.1:1, a fake `claude` binary shadowing the real one
    on PATH) or by a fixture (a fake model binary, a synthetic PostToolUse
    payload) — never by touching a real running service.
  * Each drill: induce -> observe -> assert the truthful behavior -> record
    ONE ops.run row as evidence (kind=check, service=carr-outage-drill, a
    run_key per drill, state reflecting whether the SYSTEM BEHAVED
    TRUTHFULLY, never whether the outage merely happened) -> restore the
    pre-drill state and PROVE it restored (a re-query, a file-mtime check, a
    row count back at zero).
  * A drill that finds the system did NOT tell the truth is the most useful
    possible result. This file never fixes that silently and never papers
    over it — it reports the finding plainly on stdout and via
    `record-defect` (see the drill's own comment for why that verb rather
    than `record-finding`).

WHY carr-outage-drill's EVIDENCE LANDS IN STAGING, NOT PRODUCTION. The task's
own ground rule is stricter than "don't break anything" — it is "no writes to
the production database beyond what an ordinary read does." Recording a check
row is a write. So unlike bin/restore-rehearse.sh (which rehearses against a
throwaway Neon branch but records its OWN evidence into PRODUCTION's ops.run,
because that script pre-dates this task and that choice was Joe's), every
row this file writes — the drill mechanics AND the evidence of having run —
stays inside the isolated staging project. `tools/ops-record.py trace
<correlation-id>` against staging reads it back.

USAGE
    bin/outage-drill.py --list
    bin/outage-drill.py                        # run every drill that can be
    bin/outage-drill.py --only record-layer-unreachable
    bin/outage-drill.py --dry-run              # describe, touch nothing

Exit code: 0 if every drill that ran found truthful behavior; 1 if any drill
that ran found the system did NOT tell the truth; 2 if a drill could not be
run at all (missing credential, unreachable staging) and had to be skipped.

    ROOT CAUSE OF PR #145's CI FAILURE (run 31839514568), fixed here rather

    sys.exit(...) on any failure to derive a connection string — correct for

    through every `except Exception` guard elsewhere in this file (main()'s
    startup registration, record_evidence(), and drill 1/2's own bodies),
    and on the CI runner — no NEON_API_KEY, no ~/.config/carr, no cached
    neonctl login — it did exactly that: the whole bin/outage-drill.py
    process died at the FIRST staging touch, before either fully-local drill
    (model-provider-unavailable, settings-change-db-outage) ever printed a
    line, which is why all 5 of their selftest assertions failed together.
    Reproduced locally: `NEON_API_KEY=garbage HOME=/empty` makes db_tap.dsn()
    raise SystemExit exactly this way.

    Converted to RuntimeError — an ordinary Exception — ONCE, here, so every
    existing `except Exception` call site already does the right thing
    without needing to know about this special case: main()'s startup
    registration warns and continues, record_evidence() warns per-drill
    without losing the drill's own already-printed verdict, and drills 1/2
    (which genuinely need staging) become a clean SKIPPED result instead of

    are registered only in staging, and drill 1 reported "staging may be
    unreachable right now" while staging was perfectly fine — a message that
    sent a real search after the wrong thing.

    MINTED, NOT STORED, and NOT DERIVED HERE. PR #337 hit exactly this wall from

    staging already HAS the carr_jobs role with the right grants (db/schema.sql's

    and that file mints one per run in memory after proving the owner DSN
    resolves to the staging endpoint db-tap itself derives. A stored credential

    absorbed DURABLY rather than lost, (c) a record layer that is broken all
    the way down is reported with a non-zero recorder exit and inserts nothing,
    (d) no shadow markdown file appears anywhere as a substitute for the failed
    write, and (e) the service then reads `unknown` — never `healthy` — at the
    next health look, because ops.v_service_environment_health derives health
    from the latest TERMINAL observation and its freshness and stores none
    (migration 0115's load-bearing decision).

    REVISED 2026-08-18 FOR THE RUN-ROW SPOOL, which moved the line this drill
    was reading. Before the spool, the wrapper called ops-record synchronously,
    so an unreachable database produced recorder_exit != 0 and this drill
    asserted exactly that. Since the spool, a succeeded row is queued in local
    SQLite first and replayed into the ledger by com.carr.run-spool-flush every
    30 minutes — so an unreachable database now yields recorder_exit=0, and the
    old assertion inverts: it would report the system had LIED about a
    successful recording when in fact the row is durable and en route. That
    would be the worst possible failure for a drill whose entire job is
    distinguishing truth from green.

    So the drill now proves the TWO different truths the spool created, which is
    strictly more than the one it proved before:
      * ledger unreachable, queue writable  -> recorder_exit 0, and the row is
        REALLY in the queue (checked in the queue itself, not merely claimed);
      * ledger unreachable, queue unwritable -> recorder_exit non-zero, nothing
        inserted anywhere, and the service goes `unknown` rather than staying
        green on the strength of a recording that never happened.
