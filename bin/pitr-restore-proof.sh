# pitr-restore-proof.sh — PROVE how recent a point production can be restored
# to (V5-F08, RPO cell), then judge it at the real current time.
#
# The proof itself is tools/pitr-restore-proof.py; read its header for the
# design. In one line: it writes a POSITIVE probe row, then a NEGATIVE one at
# least 5 s after an instant T, asks the provider API for a disposable branch
# whose parent is the production branch AT T, and requires the positive probe
# present and the negative ABSENT on that branch. `verify` then recomputes the
# evidence from production and the provider and pipes it to the evaluator:
#
#   tools/pitr-restore-proof.py verify | node mcp-server/bin/recovery-matrix-evaluate.mjs rpo -
#
# Production business data is never written: the only writes are the two
# ops.pitr_probe rows (migration 0597's own function, append-only table).
# No credential or connection string is printed or placed on an argument list.
#
#   bin/pitr-restore-proof.sh        # attended; needs the provider API credential
#
# Exit 0 only when the evaluator passes the RPO cell; 1 otherwise; 130 on
# Ctrl-C, 129 on a closed terminal. Every branch the proof creates carries a
# one-hour provider-side expiry; the proof also deletes its branches on every
# exit path, and the next run sweeps any a crash left behind.
