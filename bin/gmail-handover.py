"""gmail-handover.py — send a draft from the AI Gmail to a partner's CARR address.

JOE'S DESIGN, 2026-08-03: "I would rather you write at Gmail, email, and send it
to my carr account. And then I just forward it, and I remove the forward and just
send it." It is also his ORIGINAL architecture — ai-operating-notes.md:64 already
specifies drafts emailed from the AI Gmail to joe.bookout@carr.us with the
auto-send whitelist set to his own CARR address only. This implements that line.

WHY THIS AND NOT THE MAILBOX DIRECTLY. Every route into the carr.us mailbox is
closed without a CARR IT approval Joe has decided not to seek, and his reason is
sound: asking draws attention to automating a corporate mailbox. Full evidence in
decision `db40facd`; the four dead attempts are staged under _to_delete with a
WHY.md. The short version: New Outlook exposes no mailbox to AppleScript, Graph
consent is blocked tenant-wide with no request button (AADSTS90094), and IMAP
basic auth is refused despite the server advertising AUTH=PLAIN.

THE VIRTUE OF THIS ROUTE, beyond that it works: it touches CARR's systems NOT AT
ALL. Nothing registered, nothing requested, no administrator sees anything. It is
Joe's own Gmail sending mail to his own work address, which is indistinguishable
from him emailing himself. That matters more than convenience here.

WHY GMAIL CAN DO WHAT CARR CANNOT: Google still issues app passwords. That is the
exact facility CARR's tenant denies. The credential is scoped to mail, revocable
at any time from Joe's Google account, and useless for anything else.

THE ALLOWLIST IS THE SAFETY, AND IT IS STRUCTURAL. This file CAN send, which
nothing else in the system may do. It is bounded by a hardcoded recipient list of
the two partners' own addresses. A send to any other address is refused before a
connection is opened — not by discipline, not by a prompt, by the code. The
standing rule it implements is "nothing external ever auto-fires; the send
whitelist is Joe's own address only." A client, a vendor, a landlord, a listing
agent can never be reached from here, and widening this list is a decision for
Joe, in writing, not a convenience edit.

WHAT JOE DOES WITH IT: the mail lands in his CARR inbox carrying the exact text he
intends to send. He forwards it, deletes the forwarded header block, types the
real recipient, and sends from his own carr.us identity. Claude never touches the
outbound message to the actual recipient. The human gate is intact and is now the
only way anything reaches a third party.

SETUP (once, Joe's hands only — Claude never sees this value)
  App password from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords (needs 2-Step
  Verification on the account), then:

    umask 077
    printf 'CARR_GMAIL_USER=joe.bookout.carr.us@gmail.com\n' >  ~/.config/carr/gmail.env
    printf 'CARR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx\n'                  >> ~/.config/carr/gmail.env
    chmod 600 ~/.config/carr/gmail.env

USAGE
  echo '{"to":"joe","subject":"Re: suite 200","body":"..."}' | bin/gmail-handover.py
  bin/gmail-handover.py --to joe --subject 'Hi' --body 'text'
  bin/gmail-handover.py --check      verify login only, send nothing
  bin/gmail-handover.py --intended-for 'Dr. Smith <x@y.com>' ...
        adds a header line naming who the text is ultimately for, so the forward
        step does not require remembering.
