# local-briefs.sh — rebuild the two repo-bound heartbeat outputs, locally.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-04, loop #181, Joe's go). The daily heartbeat IS
# scheduled — in Cowork, which a local session cannot enumerate — and it fires
# every morning. But brief-pack and review-queue had not been rebuilt since
# 2026-08-02 15:18, an ad-hoc session run, while Monday 2026-08-03 was a full
# business day on which other scheduled work landed normally. So the trigger runs
# and these two jobs do not.
#
# THE LEADING HYPOTHESIS, and it is why the fix is a LOCAL job rather than a
# second heartbeat: a Cowork session cannot reach ~/carr-system, so it cannot
# execute `run.sh brief-pack` at all. CLAUDE.md already states a cloud session may
# see no repos; the salesforce and costar SOPs restrict themselves to local Claude
# Code for the same reason. IT IS UNTESTED — nobody has read that task's own run
# history — so this job is deliberately narrow: it fixes the OUTPUT gap without
# asserting the cause, and it is not a replacement for the heartbeat.
#
# THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY, NOT A DUPLICATE. The Cowork heartbeat does the analysis
# half — surfacing due loops, the staleness sweep, the ack clocks. This job only
# rebuilds the two artifacts that need the repo. If the Cowork side is later
# proven able to run them, retire this rather than leaving both.
#
# WEEKDAYS ONLY, before the morning heartbeat, matching the standing weekend
# stand-down: Sat/Sun are not workdays for Joe or Dell and Monday absorbs.
#
# SKIP-not-FAIL on missing env, per house convention.
#
# NORMAL MODE writes only repo-local document outputs. Drive projection is an
# explicit recovery act: pass --recovery and set CARR_RECOVERY_REASON. The
# scheduled launchd path passes neither, so it can never silently write Drive.

# today.md USED TO BE WRITTEN HERE, and the doctrine cutoff retired it on
# 2026-08-20. The block concatenated three brief-pack sections into
# 00_Context/today.md in the vault because out/ is gitignored and the call list
# had no reader — three renewal windows had expired unread while the shortlist
# sat in a folder nobody opened.
#
# THAT PROBLEM IS SOLVED BY VERBS NOW, which is the only reason this is safe to
# remove. All three sections are served live:
#   the one thing        today-triage
#   renewal windows      today-triage (the T-6 and T-3 lease-event rows)
#   the claim card       claim-card, deployed to production 2026-08-20, 141 verbs
#
# The claim card is why this waited. promote-pool and decline-candidate each tell
# the caller to read the row from v_claim_card first, and until claim-card
# shipped, the markdown card was the only reader that existed anywhere — pulling
# the file before the verb would have left both write verbs naming a surface
# nothing could reach. Verified against the live Worker before this line was
# deleted: claim-card returned the same 9,778 claimable and 388 needs-contact
# totals this block used to print.
#
# The brief-pack sections still build into out/brief-pack/ above; what ends here
# is the copy into the vault. health-check.py watches those files' mtime, so the
# freshness signal is unaffected.

# Known defect, tracked as loop #182: review-queue's touches lane reports 0 while
# ingest_inbox holds real rows, because the read fails and the handler discards
# the error message. A zero here is not yet trustworthy.
