# migrate-prod.sh — the ONE sanctioned door for applying migrations to the
# PRODUCTION database. Sanctioned by Joe 2026-08-07 night ("yea go ahead and
# build it"), widening addendum A14's build-session fence for this script only:
# sessions apply production migrations HERE, never by juggling credentials
# inline. Same code path every time (rule a8c55a47): derives the owner DSN via
# neonctl inside the process — the db-tap.py pattern — so no credential ever
# appears in a command line or a transcript.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bin/migrate-prod.sh            # dry run: list pending against production
#   ./bin/migrate-prod.sh --apply    # apply (migrate.py adds --yes only from us)
#   ./bin/migrate-prod.sh --through 0170_guidance_import_lifecycle.sql
#   ./bin/migrate-prod.sh --apply --through 0170_guidance_import_lifecycle.sql
#
# RAILS, in order:
#   1. Uncommitted migration files REFUSE to apply — production runs reviewed,
#      committed DDL only. (Dry runs are always allowed.)
#   2. Rehearse-first stays doctrine: migrations rehearse on a Neon branch
#      before this script applies them (migrations/README.md). This script
#      cannot verify that mechanically — the discipline is the builder's, and
#      the branch step is in every phase's acceptance criteria.
#   3. Every invocation logs to out/migrate-prod.log with host and outcome.

# Master plan §6: "a parked lane becomes a loud, attributed, routed decision
# within minutes of first refusal, never a discovery." Every refusal below
# sets LAST_REASON_CLASS/LAST_DETAIL/LAST_MIGRATION and then exits exactly as
# it always has; the EXIT trap turns an unhandled exit into a durable local
# receipt plus an escalation attempt, and INT/TERM get the same treatment so
# an operator's Ctrl-C or a supervisor's TERM is never a silent gap either.
#
# MP_PY / RUN_DOOR: the receipt writer and the escalation orchestrator live
# in tools/migrate-prod-support.py (JSON handling and the fsync discipline
# belong in Python, not inlined shell — design §2). RUN_DOOR is the ONE
# sanctioned Bash door (`<door> call <verb> '<json>'`) both record-layer
# calls go through; CARR_MIGRATE_PROD_RUN_DOOR is a TEST HOOK ONLY, mirroring
# the CARR_KEY_RECOVERY_TEST_SELFTEST / CARR_RESTORE_REHEARSE_SELFTEST
# precedent (bin/key-recovery-test.sh, bin/restore-rehearse.sh) — never set
# by a real invocation, so the real door is always the default.

# on the explicit COMPLETED flag, never on $?, so a signal that already ran
# on_signal cannot make on_exit fire a second time for the same refusal.
#
# SIGNAL_HANDLED, found during this build's own verification and NOT in the
# design's literal sketch: `trap - EXIT` alone does not stop zsh's EXIT trap
# from also firing when the CURRENT trap handler is itself what calls `exit`
# — reproduced directly (a minimal `trap 'f' TERM` + `trap onexit EXIT`
# script; `f` runs `trap - EXIT; exit 143`; `onexit` still ran). Gating
# on_exit on an explicit flag, exactly like COMPLETED, is what actually
# prevents the double-fire in this shell; `trap - EXIT` is kept too (it is
# correct in spirit and harmless) but the flag is the real guard.

# NON-INTERACTIVE AUTH, added 2026-08-10. neonctl's saved browser login expires

# bin/restore-rehearse.sh (the only proof the encrypted backups can be restored)

# in another lane.

# A NEON API KEY does not expire on a timer and needs no browser. neonctl reads
# it from NEON_API_KEY. This preserves the property this script was built for —
# the DSN is still derived per invocation and still never appears in a command
# line or a transcript — and only removes the human from the refresh.

# This line read `neonctl connection-string production --role-name neondb_owner`
# until 2026-08-14 and worked for as long as the account held exactly ONE Neon
# project. Program 1 created a second one (the isolated staging project), and
# from that moment neonctl refused every invocation with "Multiple projects
# found, please provide one with the --project-id option". Because the DSN was
# captured with 2>/dev/null inside a `set -eu` script, the refusal produced
# NOTHING: no message, no stderr, exit 1 and an empty log line. The one
# sanctioned door for applying production migrations was closed for every
# session on this machine and said nothing about why.
#
# The id, not the name. tools/db-tap.py pins production the same way and states
# the reason: a name lookup can drift to whatever it happens to return, and a
# name collision or typo that silently repointed this at another project is the
# worst failure this file could have. Staging is resolved by name over there
# because it is rebuilt often; production is never rebuilt.
