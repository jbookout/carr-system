# migrate-dell.sh — ONE COMMAND. Brings Dell's Mac onto the new system.
#
# Joe, 2026-08-09: "i want to get on his laptop this week (maybe tuesday) and
# just say 'do the migration' and it just happens. no human steps, no permission
# needed. it just works"
#
# So the design constraints are absolute, and every one of them is checked by
# ops/migrate-dell-selftest.py rather than trusted:
#   NO sudo.            The gate hardening was removed 2026-08-09 precisely so
#                       machine setup would never need a password again.
#   NO credentials.     No token is read, written, or prompted for.
#   NO prompts.         Nothing waits on a human. stdin is closed on every child.
#   IDEMPOTENT.         Safe to run twice, or to re-run after a partial failure.
#   FAIL LOUD.          Any step that fails aborts with a non-zero exit and says
#                       what to do. A half-migrated machine that reports success
#                       is the worst possible outcome.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose: it does not touch the record layer. Marking
# Dell's inbound items acknowledged is a VERB call, and verbs belong to the
# session driving this, not to a shell script. The script prints exactly which
# ones to close and the session does it — see THE SESSION'S HALF at the bottom.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A CHECKLIST. Every step below is currently a hand
# instruction sitting in Dell's inbound queue, where it has aged since 2026-08-06
# without being done. A checklist that has not been actioned in three days is not
# a plan. Rule a8c55a47 — a manual path and an automated path that do the same
# job must be the same code — so this script IS the migration, and the queue item
# becomes a pointer to it.

# ── PREFLIGHT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Run on the PRIMARY machine, before the visit: "is what Dell will pull actually
# going to work?" A dry run here cannot answer that — every plist already
# matches, every gate is already installed, the venv already exists — so it
# reports 13 ok / 0 fail on a packet that fails on a clean Mac. The 2026-08-10
# audit found five such defects that way, including a non-executable script that
# ended the migration at the first character.
#
# So: clone what origin/main ACTUALLY holds into a scratch HOME, at the same
# ~/carr-system path the gates resolve, and run the real verify suite there.
# Same code as the migration itself (rule a8c55a47), which is why this lives in
# this file rather than in a checklist somebody runs differently each time.
#
# Two results are EXPECTED here and are not defects, both artefacts of the
# scratch location rather than of the packet:
#   sh-destructive — the guard waives recursive deletes inside SAFE_ZONES, and
#                    /private/tmp plus "scratchpad" are both safe zones. On a
#                    real ~/carr-system the same case denies.
#   uncommitted gates — anything still in the working tree here is invisible to
#                    the clone, which is the point: it is exactly what Dell gets.

MACHINE IS MIGRATED. The gates are live immediately — Claude Code re-reads its
hooks per tool call, so every session already running on this Mac is covered
without a restart (verified 2026-08-09).

THE SESSION'S HALF — the driving session does these, not this script, because
they are record writes and records go through verbs:

  1. Call standing-context. It should return the shared rules and Dell's
     inbound queue. If it answers, the doctrine store is live for him and the
     old markdown boot path is no longer needed.

  2. Close these inbound items for Dell, since this script just did them:
       - the repo-pull item (guard protections, host allowlist, egress rebuild)
       - the doctrine-store item (his sessions now boot from the store)
     Leave the three protocol-adoption items open — those need Dell to actually
     read and agree, which no script can do for him.

  3. Tell Dell what changed on his machine, in plain words, not item numbers.
