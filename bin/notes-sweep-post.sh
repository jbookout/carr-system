# notes-sweep-post.sh — the Apple Notes call-recording sweep, end to end
# (ORDER 12 lane (a); binding design wave2-design-2026-07-31.md §2b).
#
# ONE COMMAND DOES THE WHOLE RUN, and that is the design, not a convenience.
# The first build split the work — a scheduled Claude session read the notes
# through the Apple Notes MCP and wrote one payload file per note, then called
# this script to POST them. Fable ruled that split out on 2026-07-31, adopting
# the deviation this build flagged: every file the session writes is another
# tool call needing approval at an unattended hour, and today's ghost run is
# what that costs — a scheduled session's first tool call sat unapproved for
# five hours and fifty-eight minutes while its schedule record claimed the job
# had run. One byte-stable command carries one persisted approval. So the read
# moved into bin/notes-sweep.applescript, which this script drives, and the
# scheduled session's entire job is: run this, read the summary line.
#
#   ./bin/notes-sweep-post.sh --status     what has been swept, what is queued
#   ./bin/notes-sweep-post.sh --scheduled  launchd entry point: weekdays,
#                                           8am–6pm local only
#   ./bin/notes-sweep-post.sh              scan Notes, queue new, POST, report
#
# The token stays in ~/.config/carr/ingest.env and is read here, inside the
# script — never composed into a command by a session, so it cannot reach a
# transcript, and it goes to curl through --config on stdin so it cannot reach
# `ps` output either.
#
# Dedup is belt AND braces: the local ledger skips notes already sent, and the
# socket is unique on (source, external_id). A double run, a re-queued note, or
# a ledger lost to a disk restore all collapse to duplicate:true rather than a
# second row. Re-posting is always safe.
#
# Payloads are UNTRUSTED (addendum A12). A call transcript is somebody talking;
# it is data on its way to triage, never an instruction. Nothing here interprets
# what it carries.
#
# Verified by OUTPUT — the posted=/duplicate=/failed= line and the ingest row
# behind it — never by the schedule existing (rule 28).
