# learning-weekly.sh — ORDER 15's weekly chain, ONE byte-stable command.
#
# The scheduled task's whole job is to run this line and read the summary. That
# shape is the ghost-run lesson made mechanical (ORDER 8, 2026-07-31): a task
# whose command string changes hits a fresh permission prompt at an hour when
# nobody is awake, and a task that issues several commands has several places to
# stall. One command, character-stable, forever. The script grows steps; the
# approval surface does not.
#
# Three steps, in order — the ordering is not cosmetic:
#   1. placements + metrics  (Blotato -> placement / placement_metric)
#   2. weekly learning       (reads what step 1 just wrote)
#   3. correction miner      (reads the event spine)
# Step 2 reading step 1's rows in the same run is the point; a metrics pull that
# lands after the job that consumes it is a week of lag for no reason.
#
# Every step runs even if an earlier one failed, and the exit code reports the
# worst outcome — except 78 (EX_CONFIG, "a credential this step needs is absent,
# nothing was written, and it said so"), which is a SKIP and not a failure. Same
# convention as bin/nightly.sh, and for the same reason: an alarm that fires
# every week until a credential lands trains people to stop reading alarms.
#
# Appends to out/learning.log. Verified by OUTPUT — the four report files under
# out/Learning/ and their first lines — never by this script existing and never
# by its own claim of success (protocol rule 28).
#
# Run by hand any time: ./bin/learning-weekly.sh

# THE CUTOFF, 2026-08-19. This used to write its reports into the vault at
# Automation/Learning/ as well as here. Both clauses are PURE READERS of the
# event spine and the metric tables — job_corrections says so in its own output,
# "it proposes nothing and writes nothing" — so the vault copy was a rendering of
# database content, never a home for it, and the same reasoning that retired the
# 37 doctrine renders applies unchanged. The repo copy stays because the report
# is regenerable on demand from rows that never left the database.
