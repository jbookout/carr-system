"""outlook-draft.py — put a REAL draft in Joe's carr.us Drafts folder.

THE ROUTE, and it is the only one that works. Every API into this mailbox is
closed: New Outlook exposes no mailbox to AppleScript (0 of 157 folders carry an
account), Graph consent is blocked tenant-wide with no request button
(AADSTS90094), and IMAP basic auth is refused. So this does not use an API. It
drives the Outlook APPLICATION, which Joe is already signed into, via a mailto
URL — and lets Outlook do the writing. Joe's insight, after the session had
wrongly declared the problem unsolvable: "I'm already signed in to my carr email
on the desktop app... it seems like you'd be able to make a email right into that
desktop app." Full record: decision 496bc309.

THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT GUESSABLE AND COST AN AFTERNOON TO FIND:

1. USE `open -a "Microsoft Outlook"`, NEVER a bare `open "mailto:..."`. Joe's
   DEFAULT mail handler is his personal outlook.live.com in a browser, so a bare
   open composes into the wrong account entirely. The first test looked like a
   total failure and had actually succeeded in the wrong place.

2. PERCENT-ENCODE WITH quote(), NEVER urlencode(). urlencode writes '+' for a
   space and Outlook does not decode it, so subjects arrive as "CARR+draft+test".

3. TYPE A CHARACTER BEFORE SAVING. New Outlook DISCARDS a mailto-spawned draft on
   close if it considers the message untouched — it shows in the Drafts list while
   the window is open, then vanishes. `File > Save` does not help. Cmd+S does not
   help. Typing one character marks it modified; after that File > Save commits it
   and it survives. The AppleScript types one character and deletes it, so the net
   content change is zero. Verified: draft persisted, typed character absent.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO: send. There is no send path in this file or the AppleScript.
It writes a draft and stops. Joe opens Drafts, reads it, presses Send — the one
human gate that everything else in this system is built around.
