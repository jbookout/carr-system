# cutoff-doctrine.sh — THE CUTOFF (doctrine-store P5 final act; decisions
# 20dfdfcc + 82a2fb62 + Joe's rulings 14181e60/b42f11a0). One command ends the
# vault's markdown era: the exporter flag flips, every generated .md render
# MOVES to _to_delete staging (never deleted in place — rule faae6748), and
# the store becomes the only doctrine surface.
#
#   ./bin/cutoff-doctrine.sh              # prints the plan + the two gates
#   ./bin/cutoff-doctrine.sh --fire       # executes (ask Joe first)
#
# THE TWO GATES, human-verified before --fire (this script cannot check them):
#   1. Dell acknowledged action-required A17 (his reconnect done, his sessions
#      on standing-context) — the sync contract counts business days.
#   2. One live Monday cycle ran clean on the verb paths (heartbeat + Monday
#      brief with the store-first instructions, 2026-08-10 or later).
# Firing before the gates is Joe's explicit call to make, nobody else's.

# The render list comes from the exporter registry via record-home-gate's
# parser — the same single source the write-gate trusts. .md only; xlsx/json/
# html surfaces survive the cutoff untouched.
#
# THE THREE FILES THIS LIST DOES NOT SEE, and what happened to them. Firing the
# cutoff on 2026-08-19 turned up three generated .md files written into the vault
# OUTSIDE the exporter registry, so none of them appears above:
#
#   Automation/Learning/*.md      bin/learning-weekly.sh + bin/learning-monthly.sh
#   00_Context/today.md           bin/local-briefs.sh, weekdays 06:45
#
# The first answer written here was that all three stay, on the ground that they
# are "activity digests, not doctrine." That was wrong, and it was wrong in a
# self-serving direction: each one is a RENDERING of rows that never left the
# database, which is the exact test the 37 renders above were retired against.
# job_corrections says so about itself — "it proposes nothing and writes nothing."
#
#   Learning reports — RETIRED with this cutoff. Both jobs now write only to the
#   repo's out/Learning, which is gitignored, so the personal-tier boundary the
#   vault placement protected is now structural rather than conventional. The
#   three agent definitions that read the old paths were re-pointed in the same
#   commit, and the folder's README moved to pipelines/learning-reports.md.
#
#   today.md — RETIRED 2026-08-20, once its replacement was actually serving.
#   Two of its three sections (one-thing, renewal windows) were already covered
#   by today-triage. The third was the claim card, and until claim-card shipped
#   there was NO reader for v_claim_card anywhere in the verb layer, while
#   promote-pool and decline-candidate both tell the caller to read that view
#   first — the same gap read-loop closed for loops. claim-card went to
#   production on 2026-08-20 (141 verbs) and was called live before the write
#   came out of bin/local-briefs.sh, returning the same 9,778 claimable and 388
#   needs-contact totals the file printed. Order mattered more than speed here:
#   pulling the file first would have left two write verbs naming a surface
#   nothing could reach.
