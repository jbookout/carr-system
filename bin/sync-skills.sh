# sync-skills.sh — skills are CODE (council verdict F4, decision 82a2fb62):
# canonical in the repo (carr-system/claude-tree/), synced to the Drive tree
# that local Claude Code and Cowork sessions actually load from. The Drive
# copy becomes a GENERATED projection — same law as every render: edit in the
# repo, sync, never hand-edit the projection.
#
#   ./bin/sync-skills.sh            # drift report only (hash compare)
#   ./bin/sync-skills.sh --apply    # repo → Drive, exact mirror
#
# Drift in the REPO direction (Drive file newer/different than repo) is
# REPORTED AND NEVER auto-pulled: a hand edit on the Drive side after canon
# moved is the failure this script exists to catch, not to absorb silently.
# (Bootstrap exception: until the first --apply, Drive IS the source; the
# initial repo copy was taken 2026-08-08.)
#
# THE REPORT NAMES DELETIONS SEPARATELY, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC (2026-08-21).
# It used to build one list from `rsync -rcn --delete --out-format='%n'`, which
# emits the paths the apply would ADD and is silent about the paths it would
# DELETE. Since the apply is `rsync -rc --delete`, an exact mirror, a file that
# existed only on the Drive side got removed without ever appearing in the
# report that exists to warn you first. That is not hypothetical: the
# `surface-review` skill was hand-authored on Drive on 2026-08-13, sat
# unmentioned in every drift listing for eight days, and was one --apply from
# being destroyed. A warning surface that is blind in the destructive direction
# is worse than none, because it gets consulted and believed. Deletions now get
# their own block, their own wording, and the same exit code.

# _to_delete IS OUTSIDE THE MIRROR, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (Joe's ruling, 2026-08-21).

# instead of being removed, which is the whole point of the staging habit. A
# mirror has no business touching it either way: it must not push one side's
# staging onto the other, and it must never destroy a parked file — that would
# delete the very thing staging exists to protect from deletion. Excluded on
# every rsync below, report and apply alike, so the two can never disagree.
