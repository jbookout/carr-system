# fleet-sync.sh — each Mac keeps its OWN checkout and its OWN installed gates
# current, so neither partner has to carry an update to the other by hand.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-18). Dell's Mac was migrated clean on 2026-08-11 with
# its adapter wiring exact. Over the next week the repo grew new gates
# (map-architecture, costar-lane, draft-export). Nothing on his machine ever
# fetched them, so his sessions started announcing the whole hook tuple as
# missing — and, running with no gates, had no escalation gate to stop them
# sending every blocker to Joe. He was pulled between two machines twice in one
# day: "i cant keep running back and forth between dells computer and mine."
#
# WHY THE SELF-HEAL IN gate-integrity.py IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. That repairs
# an install that lags THE LOCAL REPO. It re-runs the installer from whatever
# ops/config/hooks.json is on disk. If the CHECKOUT is the stale thing, it
# faithfully reinstalls stale gates and reports success. Something has to move
# the checkout, and before this job nothing did: all nineteen scheduled jobs
# were audited on 2026-08-18 and not one touched a git remote.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO, which is most of its design:
#   - It NEVER discards local work. A dirty tracked tree exits 78 (skip) with
#     the paths named. Dell's machine deliberately carries two uncommitted edits
#     from his migration; a blind fast-forward would have destroyed them.
#   - It NEVER merges, rebases, resets or force-anythings. Fast-forward only.
#     If the branches have diverged it skips and says so — a diverged checkout
#     is a human question, not a job's decision.
#   - It NEVER runs off main, and never inside a worktree. Worktree-per-session
#     means most sessions run somewhere else entirely; syncing from there would
#     move a branch somebody is mid-edit on.
#
# SIBLING REPOS (2026-09-23). Joe wants EVERY GitHub checkout on a Mac to stay
# current, not just this one: "if im on my macbook working or my studio or
# whatever, i dont want to have to remember to do that." The sibling list
# (currently doctorcre-app, software-factory) lives in ONE place,
# ops/config/fleet-sync-siblings.json, and each sibling is synced through
# tools/fleet_sync_sibling_safety.py under the exact same fail-closed contract
# as this checkout: absent -> skip, off-main -> skip, dirty -> skip and name
# the paths, diverged -> skip, otherwise fetch + `merge --ff-only`. A sibling's
# own skip or failure is INTENTIONALLY ignored below — see sync_siblings() —
# so it can never prevent this checkout's own sync, the wiring re-render, or
# change this job's own exit code.
#
# Exit codes follow bin/run-scheduled.sh's convention: 0 did something or was
# already current, 78 deliberately skipped and said why, anything else failed.
# This convention is about the CANONICAL checkout only; the sibling repos are
# reported (one line each) but never participate in it.

# Never wait on a login prompt. This runs unattended from launchd; if GitHub
# ever wants credentials again (expired token, revoked login), a git allowed to
# prompt sits waiting for an answer nobody types and the run stalls instead of
# skipping. With these, the fetch fails fast and the existing "fetch failed"
# skip path reports it. The keychain credential helper still answers silently.
