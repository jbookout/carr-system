# import-doctrine.sh — the sanctioned door for doctrine-store imports into
# PRODUCTION (Joe, 2026-08-08: "sanction the import door"), second member of
# the door family bin/migrate-prod.sh founded. Same construction: the
# credential is derived in-process via neonctl (never on a command line),
# dry-run is the default, and every invocation logs.
#
# Usage (arguments pass through to pipelines/doctrine_import.py):
#   ./bin/import-doctrine.sh --batch-no 1 --phase forced_early --class playbook \
#       --files "<vault>/DNA/writing-rules.md" ...            # dry parse
#   ./bin/import-doctrine.sh ... --apply                      # import
#
# RAILS:
#   1. --apply refuses while the importer itself has uncommitted changes —
#      production runs reviewed, committed code (the migrate-prod rail that
#      caught stranded 0074 on its first run).
#   2. Runs as app_writer, NOT the owner: the runtime-role lesson from 0076/0077
#      applied — if grants are missing, this door fails loudly instead of the
#      Worker failing later.
#   3. The importer's own ledger (doctrine_migration_batch) + hash reconcile
#      remain the real integrity rails; this script adds credential hygiene.
