"""probe-keepalive.py — ask the three long-running servers whether they are up,
and write the answer to the ledger.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. call-mode, doc-engine and quill-dictate are launchd
KeepAlive agents. Everything else on this Mac answers "did it fire recently";
these three need "is it up", and nothing could ask it. They are deliberately not
wrapped by bin/run-scheduled.sh — the wrapper records when its child EXITS, and
a KeepAlive child exiting means launchd restarted it, so wrapping would file a
row per restart and read as repeated failures of a service working exactly as
designed. They were therefore registered with no cadence, which made them
honest and invisible at the same time: `ops-record health` had nothing to say
about them, and ops/edge-liveness.py could not help either, because a service
with no cadence never goes stale.

THE MOVE IS TO TURN "IS IT UP" INTO A CADENCE. This probe runs on a schedule and
records one run row per server per pass. That single change makes both existing
mechanisms work on them for free:
  * a server that is DOWN records state=failed, and `ops-record assess` turns
    that into an incident on the same path every other failure takes;
  * if the probe itself stops — the Mac is off, asleep, or logged out — the
    three services go stale on their newly-registered cadence and
    ops/edge-liveness.py alarms from GitHub.
Nothing new had to be invented for either. The probe only had to make them
speak.

── THE THREE ARE NOT PROBED EQUALLY, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN SMOOTHED ──

    call-mode    TCP 127.0.0.1:4682   a connect proves it is ACCEPTING
    doc-engine   TCP 127.0.0.1:4680   a connect proves it is ACCEPTING
    quill-dictate  (no socket)        process liveness ONLY

A TCP connect is a real answer: something is listening and completed a
handshake. Process liveness is a weaker claim and must never be reported as if
it were the same one — a wedged process, a deadlocked one, and a healthy one all
have a PID. quill-dictate is a desk dictation agent with no port to knock on, so
process liveness is the strongest signal available, and the detail line on its
run row says which signal was used so nobody reads the row as more than it is.

WHAT THIS PROBE STILL CANNOT SEE, for either kind: a server that accepts a
connection and then answers nonsense. Proving that needs a protocol-level
request, which needs each server's request shape, which is a bigger and
separate piece of work. An honest partial signal beats a confident wrong one,
so the limit is written here rather than discovered later.

── EXIT CODE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0 when the PROBE worked, whatever it found. A down server is carried by the row
it recorded, not by this process's exit code — this script is itself wrapped by
bin/run-scheduled.sh, so exiting non-zero for a down server would file a second
failure against the probe's own service and report one outage twice under two
names. Non-zero here means the probe could not do its job.
