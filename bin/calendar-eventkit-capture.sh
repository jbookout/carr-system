#!/bin/sh
# calendar-eventkit-capture.sh — the unattended calendar capture, replacing the
# published-feed fetch Joe turned off on 2026-08-14.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. calendar-fetch-daily read a PUBLISHED calendar feed, and
# Microsoft strips ATTENDEE and ORGANIZER from that feed by design: a backfill
# over it matched 6 events out of 81. Reading the LOCAL calendar instead finds
# attendee emails on roughly half of all events — 386 of 936 on the 2026-08-13
# dump. Same meetings, the half that names who was in the room.
#
# THE ONE MECHANIC THAT MATTERS, and the reason this is a script rather than a
# line in a plist: the read MUST be launched with `open -a`, never by executing
# the bundle's inner binary. macOS attributes calendar permission to the
# RESPONSIBLE PROCESS. Launched properly, the bundle is responsible and holds the
# grant. Exec the inner binary and the responsible process is the shell, which has
# no usage description and no grant — macOS then answers DENIED without ever
# prompting. Both were measured on 2026-08-14 within two minutes of each other:
#
#     direct exec of Contents/MacOS/carr-calendar-access -> "DENIED", exit 3
#     open -a "CARR Calendar Access.app"                 -> real events, exit 0
#
# A DENIAL AND AN EMPTY CALENDAR MUST NEVER LOOK THE SAME. That confusion is the
# defect that started this whole thread: a verb answered emptily instead of
# refusing, and the empty answer was read as truth. So this script treats DENIED
# as a hard failure with its own exit code, and never reports "0 touches" when
# what actually happened was "not allowed to look".
#
# WHAT IT WRITES, and what it deliberately does not:
#   EXACT email matches  -> logged as touches. An exact address is evidence a
#                           NAMED person was in the room.
#   DOMAIN-only matches  -> reported, never logged. "Someone from that org" is
#                           not a dated touch on an individual.
#   Unknown externals    -> durably queued for local-mail search, research and
#                           evidenced canonical intake through the Model Room.
#
# RISK: YELLOW. Reads the calendar read-only, writes only internal touch records,
# sends nothing outside and publishes nothing.
#
#   bin/calendar-eventkit-capture.sh            # capture, log exact touches
#   bin/calendar-eventkit-capture.sh --dry-run  # report only, write nothing
#   bin/calendar-eventkit-capture.sh --dry-run --receipt-safe  # aggregate-only receipt output
