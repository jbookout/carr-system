#!/bin/sh
# schema-snapshot.sh — write (or verify) db/schema.sql, the checked-in structure
# of the production database.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The 130 migrations were treated as the way to build a
# database. On 2026-08-13 CI applied them to a genuinely empty Postgres for the
# first time and proved they cannot: several are DATA backfills carrying guards
# like "remapped ZERO deals — stop and report, do not force". Those guards are
# correct — they catch a backfill that silently did nothing to production — but
# they assert on business data that only production has, so an empty database
# legitimately refuses them. That is by design, not a bug, and no amount of
# adding rows fixes it.
#
# THE DECISION (2026-08-13, internal, mine to make per the escalation gate).
# Stop treating replay-from-zero as how an environment gets built. This snapshot
# is the structure; the migrations govern changes going FORWARD. Doctrine's
# requirement that "a fresh non-production environment can be reconstructed from
# repository declarations" is still met, because this file IS a repository
# declaration — and unlike the replay it actually works.
#
# The two rejected alternatives, recorded so nobody re-litigates them blind:
#   * Teach every data backfill to skip its guard when the table is empty. Keeps
#     the replay story literally true, but every future backfill has to remember
#     the pattern and forgetting it is SILENT — the guard just quietly stops
#     protecting anything. Ongoing discipline debt with nothing enforcing it.
#   * Split into replayable schema migrations and production-only data lanes.
#     Cleanest on paper, but it adds a judgment call to every future change, and
#     a wrong call puts a data move where it will be replayed against an empty
#     database — the exact failure being fixed.
#
# NO BUSINESS DATA, EVER. Three things go in and nothing else: the STRUCTURE
# (--schema-only), the APPLIED-MIGRATION LEDGER, and the REFERENCE VOCABULARY
# named in the explicit list below. No clients, no deals, no parties, no notes,
# no events. That is what makes this file safe to commit, and the vocabulary list
# is hand-checked rather than pattern-matched precisely so it can never widen
# into business data by accident. pipelines/staging-isolation-proof.sql asserts
# the business tables are empty after a load, so a mistake here is caught rather
# than discovered. --no-owner --no-acl for the same reason
# bin/backup-dump.sh uses them: an embedded OWNER TO / GRANT names roles a fresh
# database has never heard of, and the first such statement aborts the load.
#
# "Grants are rebuilt by the migrations, which are in git" — this file's
# original claim, and it has the same shelf life the role claim had: true only
# while the granting migrations are PENDING. Once the ledger absorbs them, the
# grants stop running anywhere, and a database built from this snapshot has the
# roles (preamble below) holding NOTHING. That is exactly how CI's migration
# class ran green while proving nothing about privileges — discovered 2026-08-14
# on PR #75, where verifying carr_writer's insert on lead meant replaying
# 0001-0004 by hand because the database CI builds could not answer the
# question. So the snapshot carries the app roles' ACLs itself: the CARR GRANTS
# section below reads them from production's catalogs and emits plain GRANTs,
# scoped to the app roles only so no other principal's ACLs enter the tree.
# tools/test-schema-snapshot-grants.py pins the shapes it must carry.
#
# THE ROLES THEMSELVES ARE NOT, and assuming they were is a bug this file shipped
# on 2026-08-14. The reasoning above was true only while every role-creating
# migration was still PENDING relative to this snapshot: 0115 declares
# carr_reader, carr_writer and carr_exporter (NOLOGIN privilege bundles), so while the
# ledger stopped at 0114 a fresh database got the roles by replaying it. The
# moment a refresh advanced the ledger PAST 0115, that migration stopped being
# pending, the role creation stopped running anywhere, and the next migration to
# grant against those roles died with `role "carr_jobs" does not exist` — which
# is exactly how CI failed on migration 0117.
#
# The snapshot is the base for every fresh database, so it has to carry the
# roles itself rather than inherit them from a migration it has already absorbed.
# The privilege bundles remain NOLOGIN. carr_jobs is different: it is the
# narrow unattended runtime identity, so the preamble creates it LOGIN with an
# unprinted random placeholder, or converts an older NOLOGIN placeholder. An
# already-login carr_jobs is left exactly as it is, including its password.
# Production is untouched because its existing carr_jobs is already LOGIN.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/schema-snapshot.sh            # regenerate db/schema.sql from production
#   bin/schema-snapshot.sh --check    # non-zero if the checked-in file is stale
#   bin/schema-snapshot.sh --from-disposable-local postgres://carr_ci@127.0.0.1:<port>/carr_ci
#       # generate only from the loopback disposable PG17 full-build target
#   bin/schema-snapshot.sh --from-disposable-local <dsn> --verify-only
#       # validate the disposable candidate without changing db/schema.sql
#
# Needs production access, so it runs on Joe's Mac and never in CI — CI consumes
# the committed file and cannot reach production by construction.

-- CARR ROLE PREAMBLE (bin/schema-snapshot.sh) — not produced by pg_dump.
--
-- This dump is --no-owner --no-acl, so it names no roles and grants nothing.
-- The roles still have to EXIST before the pending migrations that grant to
-- them run, and they can no longer be got by replaying 0115: once this
-- snapshot's ledger passed 0115 that migration stopped being pending anywhere.
-- carr_exporter aged into the same trap by way of 0006 and joined the list on
-- 2026-08-14, when the grants section below started carrying its privileges.
-- carr_authority aged into it by way of 0161 and joined on 2026-08-19: the
-- refresh that carried the ledger past 0161 stopped that migration replaying,
-- and the next rebuild failed five db-gates with `role "carr_authority" does
-- not exist`. That is the third time this exact trap has been sprung, so the
-- rule it teaches is worth stating plainly: ANY migration that creates a role
-- must add that role here in the same change, because the day its ledger entry
-- lands is the day it stops creating anything.
-- carr_device_evidence made it FOUR, the same day and on this same branch, by
-- way of 0163. It surfaced only after the guidance and retrieval seed rows were
-- added, because control-plane-db-gate could not reach the privilege check that
-- names it until the gates ahead of it stopped failing — and when it did reach
-- it, it did not fail cleanly: `has_function_privilege('carr_device_evidence',
-- ...)` RAISES on a missing role, so the gate crashed with a traceback instead
-- of a finding. Four for four, every one caught by a rebuild rather than by the
-- change that created the role.
--
-- All privilege bundles whose creating migrations are in the snapshot ledger
-- are created here. carr_backup (LOGIN) is deliberately NOT: it is the backup credential,
-- bin/backup-dump.sh supplies it, no gate asks for it, and creating a second
-- login role with a placeholder password to satisfy nothing is a cost with no
-- buyer. If a gate ever needs it, add it the way carr_jobs is added, not by
-- widening a pattern.
-- carr_reader, carr_writer, carr_exporter, carr_authority,
-- carr_device_evidence, the four calendar-prebrief roles, and the renewal
-- source-attestor role are privilege
-- bundles, so they stay NOLOGIN. carr_jobs is
-- the narrow unattended runtime identity: a fresh
-- rebuild must make it LOGIN. If an older snapshot created it NOLOGIN, convert
-- it with a fresh random placeholder password; an already-login role is left
-- completely unchanged. The placeholder is generated in-process and never
-- selected, logged, or written into this dump.

  -- applied while the file it vouches for described a database where it never

  -- too with no edit here. Announced rather than skipped in silence, per rule

# THE CARR GRANTS SECTION. --no-acl stays — a raw ACL dump names Neon's own
# principals and whatever login roles neonctl has minted per environment, and
# the first grant naming an absent role aborts the load. Instead the app roles'
# privileges are read from the catalogs and emitted as plain GRANTs, scoped by
# grantee to the NOLOGIN bundles plus the narrow carr_jobs login the preamble
# creates. Membership
# bundles may additionally name neondb_owner (0005/0006 grant it the bundles),
# which every loading environment already has: .github/workflows/ci.yml creates
# it for the same reason.
#
# The section rides AFTER the structure because a grant on a table that does
# not exist yet aborts the load, and BEFORE the ledger because it is structure,
# not data. SIX shapes, each ordered deterministically so --check reports
# drift and nothing else: PUBLIC revokes, schema usage, relation grants (tables,
# views, sequences), column-scoped grants (0021, 0117 — where the columns
# OUTSIDE the list are the point), function execute (0094, 0106), and
# memberships.
#
# THE PUBLIC REVOKES COME FIRST AND ARE THE ONLY SHAPE THAT TAKES A PRIVILEGE
# AWAY, added 2026-08-19. Postgres grants EXECUTE on every new function to
# PUBLIC by default, and PUBLIC includes every role, so a migration that means
# to keep a function to one principal has to revoke that default explicitly —
# 0168 does exactly this: `revoke all on function ops.record_guidance_decision
# (uuid,text,text,text) from public,carr_writer`. This section emitted only
# GRANTs, so a database built from the snapshot got every function back at its
# permissive default while the revoke that tightened it sat in a migration the
# ledger had already absorbed.
#
# That is the same aging trap as the roles, one level down, and it fails in the
# more dangerous direction: a rebuilt environment is LOOSER than production, not
# broken, so nothing refuses to start — CI's db-gates caught it as
# "carr_writer can execute authority function ops.record_guidance_decision",
# "browser challenge ledger grant leaked" and "raw plan/acceptance authority
# leaked" only because those gates assert the boundary directly. Production is
# unaffected: it holds the revokes already, and this file is never loaded into
# it.
#
# Read from production's catalogs like everything else here. A NULL proacl means
# the function still carries the default, so there is nothing to revoke; a
# non-null proacl that does not name PUBLIC (grantee 0) is a function whose
# default was deliberately taken away, and that is what gets emitted.

# REFERENCE VOCABULARY IS A THIRD CATEGORY, and leaving it out made the first
# staging build useless. It is neither structure nor business data: closed sets
# like the eight deal phases or the six client statuses, seeded by migrations,
# pointed at by foreign keys. A database with the structure and none of these
# cannot hold a single row — client.status is a foreign key to client_status,
# which was empty. Verified on the first staging load: 115 tables, 0 statuses.
#
# THE LIST IS EXPLICIT AND HAND-CHECKED, never pattern-matched. Every table below
# was counted on production first (2 to 18 rows each, all closed vocabularies).
# A pattern like "small tables" or "tables seeded by a migration" would sweep in
# client, party and event, which the same migrations also insert into — dumping
# those would put real client data in a tracked file, which is the one outcome
# this whole design exists to prevent.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, and worth stating rather than leaving to inference:
#   * system_config (21 rows) — operational settings, not vocabulary, and the
#     kind of table where a value that should never be committed can appear.
#     Staging can set its own.
#   * client, party, deal, event and every other business table — the point.
# `actor` (12 rows) IS included: internal actor identities (joe, dell, system,
# automation) that events carry foreign keys to. Not client data.
#
# TWO SEEDED CONFIGURATION TABLES JOINED ON 2026-08-19, on Joe's ruling, and they
# widen this list's category from "closed vocabulary" to "rows production has
# that a rebuild silently lacks". Both are data steps inside migrations the
# ledger has now absorbed, so the migration no longer replays and a database
# built from this file gets the table and none of its rows — the same aging trap
# as the roles and the PUBLIC revokes above, one level further in:
#   * ops.guidance_registry (1 row) — the registry's own header row, created by
#     0168's `insert into ops.guidance_registry(created_by)`. Without it
#     guidance-registry-db-gate fails on "expected one row ... where singleton".
#   * retrieval_proposal (10 rows, all pending) — 0135's own "Seed evidence
#     only" block, which it says "activate nothing until Joe or Dell approves
#     the batch". Without them situation-retrieval-db-gate fails on "expected 10
#     pending seed proposals, found 0".
#   * retrieval_ranking_policy (2 rows) — the versioned ranking policies,
#     coequal-normalized-v1 (active, default) and lexical-dominant-v1
#     (candidate). The active row carries golden_suite_digest, which
#     assert_situation_retrieval_golden() looks up BY DIGEST; with no policy row
#     the lookup returns null and it raises "golden suite digest mismatch".
#     Found only after adding the two above, because the gate could not reach
#     this check until it got past the proposals.
#   * The exact two reviewed ops.enforcement_control_catalog controls are
#     verified separately and appended as deterministic SQL below — never via
#     the vocabulary pg_dump. Their fixed implementation/test references,
#     enforcement classes, and installed/verification metadata contain no
#     client, deal, event, secret, or runtime usage data. 0194 is already in a
#     rebuilt snapshot's ledger, so its seed does not replay; without this
#     controlled block the 0228 lifecycle cannot validate pinned rules. Do not
#     add rule_control_binding or any receipt/rule table: those are per-rule
#     history, not bounded internal control configuration.
#   * ops.rule_delivery_policy (exactly 1 row) and
#     ops.rule_delivery_activation_target (the exact ledger-appropriate row set) are the bounded
#     configuration for the already-existing scoped rule-delivery cutover.
#     0291 and 0317 seed them, but once those migrations enter this snapshot's
#     ledger they no longer replay. Omitting the rows produced mode:null and no
#     cutover target set on a fresh rebuild. Carry these two tables only; never
#     add ops.rule_delivery_observation, ops.rule_delivery_activation_receipt,
#     or any other runtime/evidence table to this list.
#   * The disabled renewal-radar-source-daily v1 job definition is a fixed
#     internal contract required by 0230's lease-bound delivery gate. Carry
#     only that exact row; never widen this to arbitrary job/runtime rows.
#
# I counted every other table 0135 and 0168 seed, so the next rebuild does not
# discover a fourth one the same way: doctrine_concept_mapping,
# retrieval_concept, retrieval_phrase, ops.guidance_authority_binding,
# ops.guidance_situation_mapping and ops.guidance_registry_event are all EMPTY on
# production and need nothing. retrieval_query_log has 185 rows and is
# deliberately EXCLUDED — it is a usage log, not configuration, it carries the
# text of real queries, and no gate asks for it.
# HAND-CHECKED BEFORE ADDING, which is the rule this list lives by: counted on
# production (exactly 1 and exactly 10, all ten still pending), and every payload
# read. They are search concepts and phrases about this system's own runbooks —
# "record layer outage diagnosis", "how the operating playbook learns from
# mistakes". No client, party, deal, note or event appears in either table.
#
# THE LINE THAT STILL HOLDS, so this widening does not become a licence: a table
# qualifies because someone read its rows and can say what is in them, never
# because a migration seeded it. "Tables seeded by a migration" would sweep in
# client, party and event, which the same migrations also insert into.

# The control catalog is deliberately NOT a --table dump: carrying every row
# would let arbitrary implementation prose into a tracked snapshot. Instead the
# REPOSITORY names which controls may be carried, the source is verified to hold
# every one of them, and only those are rendered — so an applied seed ledger
# cannot hide missing mutable seed rows, and nothing reaches the snapshot that
# this repository has not declared.
#
# WIDENED 2026-08-22, from two hand-listed keys to the full declared set, and the
# reason is the trap that made it necessary. The catalog is what approve-rule
# consults, and until this week it held three controls against the 59 the
# repository described, so approving a rule enforced by any of the rest needed a
# hand-written migration first. Migrations 0274 and 0275 seeded it from
# ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json and its companion class file. But the
# moment those migrations entered Production's ledger they entered this snapshot
# too, so a database rebuilt from the snapshot considered them applied, never ran
# them, and came up with an empty catalog — failing
# ops/control-catalog-parity-gate.py on 60 absent controls. A snapshot that
# carries a migration's LEDGER ROW but not the rows it seeded describes a
# database nobody can rebuild.
#
# THE BOUNDARY THAT MATTERS IS UNCHANGED, and it is not the number two: it is
# that the key list comes from the repository rather than from whatever happens
# to be in Production. ops/sync_control_catalog.py compiles it from the same two
# declaration files the seeding migrations were generated from, so a row can only
# ride along in this snapshot if a reviewed repository change put its key there.
# A control present in the source and absent from the declarations is NOT
# rendered — it is left for ops/control-catalog-parity-gate.py to report, which
# is how ci_gates was found on 2026-08-22.
# The declared control keys, compiled from the repository's own declarations by
# the same module that generates the seeding migrations. A quoted, comma-joined
# SQL list; the count is asserted separately so a silently empty list cannot pass.

# into db/schema.sql as though it matched the declaration. A declared control
# whose Production row had drifted rode into a tracked file unreviewed.

# TWO GOVERNED EXECUTION SEEDS JOINED ON 2026-08-25, after 0309 and 0310
# entered the production ledger.  Neither is a vocabulary row and neither is
# safe to recover by dumping the whole table: execution-environment tables
# contain append-only provider evidence, while ops.job_definition contains
# live runtime contracts.  A snapshot that carries the ledger but omits these
# two bounded repository-declared rows cannot bind a fresh Work Request to the
# active Hermes local environment or admit an Engineering Passport slice.
#
# The values below are the exact reviewed built-in seed from 0309 and the
# final engineering-slice:v1 contract from 0310 through 0312.  They are deliberately
# rendered from repository text, with no production payload or observed
# timestamp copied into the tracked snapshot.  The fixed conformance time is
# a historical source observation, not a freshness claim; the provider's
# active state and passed conformance remain the authoritative admission facts.

# THE SIEP MANIFEST AND ITS WORK REQUESTS joined on 2026-08-27, the sixth entry
# in the seeded-configuration category above, and the first whose seed is SEALED.
# The trap is the control-catalog one a level deeper (incident INC-20260827-04's
# sibling, defect class snapshot-cannot-rebuild-sealed-seeded-manifest): 0324
# seeds ops.siep_package_contract / siep_program_dependency / siep_component_alias
# and then seals all three with unconditional before-insert triggers, and the
# package contract carries NOT NULL foreign keys into ops.work_request rows that
# 0324 itself creates. Once 0324 enters this snapshot's ledger nothing replays,
# the vocabulary dump cannot pass the seals, and a rebuilt database has SIEP
# structure with an empty, unseedable manifest — siep-program-local-pg-gate
# fails on the full package set (found live on the first post-0324 snapshot,
# pull request 712, closed unmerged).
#
# THE SHAPE CHOSEN, of the three recorded on WR-000016: a deterministic block
# that restores the exact production rows with the seals and the two
# work-request insert guards (plus the shape gate) disabled for the restore
# only, then re-enabled, then VERIFIED — the block ends by asserting
# ops.siep_manifest_digest() equals the digest read from production at snapshot
# time, so the seal's intent (no unreviewed manifest) survives the trip: a
# tampered block fails the rebuild instead of building quietly. The manifest
# rows are literal in reviewed migration 0324, so the production dump IS the
# reviewed content, and the digest proves it twice — here at write time and
# again at load time. The SIEP work requests are internal program rows created
# by 0324's own literal package list (requester joe, owner joe, no client,
# party, deal, event, doctrine or credential reference; their only outbound
# foreign key is public.actor, which this snapshot already carries).
# jsonb_populate_record keeps the block column-list-free so a later work_request
# column cannot silently rot it. The ref sequence is advanced to production's
# value so a rebuilt database cannot mint a colliding WR ref. Never widen this
# to siep_command_receipt, siep_lane_lock, or any other runtime/evidence table.

# THE SIXTH INSTANCE WAS CAUGHT BY HAND; THE SEVENTH IS CAUGHT HERE. Every block
# above this line was written one at a time, each after a database rebuilt from
# this file failed a db-gate days later: the role preamble, the control catalog,
# the guidance registry and retrieval seeds, the rule-delivery policy and
# targets, the governed execution providers, and now the sealed SIEP manifest.
# Six blocks, one shape — a migration seeds rows, this snapshot's ledger absorbs
# the migration so it never replays, and the rows are simply gone. Until now
# nothing would have noticed the next one.
#
# It runs HERE, against the composed artifact and before the write/--check
# branch, for two reasons. The artifact is the only place holding both halves of
# the question — the applied-migration ledger and the data statements — so the
# check reads the exact bytes about to be committed rather than asking
# production a second question whose answer could differ. And refusing before
# the write means a rejected run leaves db/schema.sql untouched.
#
# IT NEVER ADDS A TABLE. What a table carries into a tracked file stays a
# reviewed decision, per the rule this file already lives by: a table qualifies
# because someone read its rows and can say what is in them, never because a
# migration seeded it. All this does is refuse to let an unclassified one pass
# in silence.
