# restore-rehearse.sh — prove the encrypted backups can actually come BACK.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-02 cold-session audit). bin/backup-dump.sh has been
# writing encrypted dumps since 2026-07-30 and NOTHING has ever read one. A grep
# across the whole repo for `age -d`, `age --decrypt`, `pg_restore` and
# `psql ... backups/` returned zero hits: no code existed that could restore
# these files, so "we have backups" was an assumption, not a fact. Three things
# make that assumption expensive to keep:
#   1. Neon's point-in-time-restore window is SIX HOURS. Past that, these dumps
#      are the only history that exists. There is no vendor safety net behind
#      them.
#   2. backup-dump.sh runs inside the nightly chain, which is skipped whenever
#      the Mac sleeps through 2am. The gap is visible in backups/ right now:
#      2026-07-30, 2026-07-31, then 2026-08-02. No 08-01. A backup you cannot
#      restore AND cannot count on being there is two unknowns stacked.
#   3. An unrestorable dump is indistinguishable from a good one until the day
#      you need it, which is the worst possible day to find out.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Creates a throwaway Neon branch, restores the newest
# backups/*.sql.age into a brand-new database ON that branch, compares row
# counts table-by-table against production, reports PASS/FAIL loudly, and
# deletes the branch. Re-runnable: the branch name carries a UTC timestamp, so
# two runs never collide, and teardown runs from a trap so it happens even on
# a failure or a Ctrl-C.
#
#   ./run.sh restore-rehearse                  # the full rehearsal
#   ./run.sh restore-rehearse --preflight      # checks only; creates nothing
#   ./run.sh restore-rehearse --identity path  # where the age private key is
#   ./run.sh restore-rehearse --keep-branch    # leave the branch for debugging
#
# THE PRIVATE KEY IS NOT OPTIONAL AND NOT STORED HERE. backups-public-key.txt in
# the repo can only ENCRYPT. Decryption needs ~/.config/carr/age-key.txt (600,
# local, plus the offline copy Joe owes per secrets-inventory.md). Override with
# --identity or CARR_AGE_IDENTITY. The key check runs FIRST, before anything is
# created or charged for, so a keyless run costs nothing and says exactly what
# is missing.
#
# ── PRODUCTION IS NEVER WRITTEN. Four independent guards, because one is a
#    promise and four is a design:
#   1. The ONLY statement this script ever sends to production is a read, and
#      that session is opened with default_transaction_read_only=on via
#      PGOPTIONS. A stray write errors at the server, not at our good intentions.
#   2. The restore target DSN is asserted to resolve to a DIFFERENT HOST than
#      production. Every Neon branch gets its own compute endpoint hostname
#      (verified 2026-08-02: production is ep-restless-resonance-…, a branch is
#      ep-damp-star-…), so a same-host restore target means something is wrong
#      and we stop rather than guess.
#   3. The restore goes into a NEW DATABASE created for this run, never into the
#      branch's inherited copy of neondb. Nothing is dropped, anywhere, ever —
#      this script contains no DROP and no TRUNCATE. A restore rehearsal that
#      needs to destroy something first is one typo away from destroying the
#      wrong thing.
#   4. Teardown deletes a branch BY THE ID neonctl handed back when we created
#      it this run, never by name and never by search. The default branch id is
#      also checked explicitly, so the delete cannot reach production even if
#      the create step returned something unexpected.
#
# ── THE DECRYPTED DUMP IS PRODUCTION DATA IN CLEARTEXT. It lands in a mktemp -d
#    (mode 700) outside the repo, never in backups/ and never anywhere git can
#    see, and the same trap that deletes the branch removes it. --keep-branch
#    keeps the BRANCH, never the plaintext; there is no flag that keeps the
#    plaintext, on purpose.

# captured psql's stderr only, so age's "unknown identity type" scrolled past
# while the diagnostic tail printed an empty file — the script reported a failure
# and then showed nothing about it. The single most useful line this can ever
# print is age's "no identity matched any of the recipients", so it goes where
# the tail will find it.
#
# pipefail matters just as much: without it the pipeline's status is psql's, and
# psql exits 0 on an empty stdin. A failed decrypt would have loaded nothing and
# passed.

#
# FOUND BY THE FIRST REAL RUN, 2026-08-02: the restore died on
#   ERROR: permission denied to change default privileges
# `bin/backup-dump.sh` calls plain `pg_dump` with no --no-owner/--no-acl, so
# every dump carries ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES / GRANT / REVOKE / OWNER TO
# statements naming the role that owned the source database. Restoring into a
# fresh database on a branch, those roles are not ours to act for, so the first
# one errors and ON_ERROR_STOP=1 abandons the whole load. The DATA was never the
# problem; the permission grammar wrapped around it was.
#
# backup-dump.sh is fixed so future dumps carry none of this. That does NOT help
# the dumps we already hold, and those are the only backups that exist — which is
# exactly the situation a restore has to survive. So the stream is filtered here.
#
# ON_ERROR_STOP STAYS 1. Dropping it would have been one word and would have made
# every future failure silent — a restore that skips a broken COPY and reports
# success is worse than one that fails loudly, and is the same false-comfort
# defect this whole drill was built to expose. Filtering removes exactly the
# statement classes we know cannot apply and leaves every other error fatal.
#
# FOUND AGAIN BY THE 2026-08-17 PRE-ACTIVATION RECOVERY DRILL: scoped plain-SQL
# dumps now include `CREATE SCHEMA public;`, while a newly created PostgreSQL
# database already owns that schema. ON_ERROR_STOP correctly refused the
# duplicate before loading a table. `public` is the only pre-created schema;
# `CREATE SCHEMA ops;` must remain and every table/COPY error stays fatal. Strip
# exactly that one idempotent declaration, not CREATE SCHEMA generally.
#
# The count assertion in phase 4 is what proves the filter did not eat data: ACL
# statements move no rows, so if stripping them changed a single count, the
# comparison fails.

# per-table equality check would go red every single run on nothing but normal
# churn — the "an alarm that fires every day trains people to stop reading
# alarms" failure bin/nightly.sh already had to fix once. Per-table deltas are
# therefore REPORTED, not gated. What IS gated:
#   FAIL  a table present in production is missing from the restore
#   FAIL  a table with rows in production restored with zero rows
#   FAIL  the restored total is below FLOOR_PCT% of production's total
# Those three catch the failure modes that actually exist — a dependency error
# that skips a table, a truncated dump, a half-written file — without pretending
# a moving database should match a snapshot to the row.
# NO SORT FUNCTION IS USED HERE, deliberately. The first draft called asorti(),
# which is a gawk extension: macOS ships the one-true-awk (version 20200816) and
# died with "calling undefined function asorti" on the first fixture run. Both
# input files already arrive sorted — the counting query ends in `order by
# table_name` — so walking them in file order gives sorted output for free.
# Production's tables print first, then any table the dump carries that
# production no longer has. Row counts are summed with explicit counters rather
