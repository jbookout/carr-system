# refresh-rules.sh — close the same-day taught-rules gap (Joe, 2026-07-31:
# "i dont love that it lags over night").
#
# The compiled-rules files are the BINDING auto-loaded surface; a rule taught
# from Cowork/phone mid-day sat in the DB until the 2am chain re-rendered them.
# This job re-renders JUST those two files every 30 minutes (launchd), so the
# lag drops from overnight to ~half an hour whenever this Mac is awake.
# Pure code, no model (T0 per model-tiering). Full chain still owns 2am.
#
# SKIP-not-FAIL: missing env = exit 0 with a SKIP line, per house convention.
