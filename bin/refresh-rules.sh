# refresh-rules.sh — close the same-day taught-rules gap (Joe, 2026-07-31:
# "i dont love that it lags over night").
#
# The compiled-rules files are the BINDING auto-loaded surface; a rule taught
# from Cowork/phone mid-day sat in the DB until the 2am chain re-rendered them.
# This job re-renders JUST those two files HOURLY, 7:00-20:00 local (launchd
# StartCalendarInterval) — business hours only, on Joe's cost ruling 2026-07-31:
# Neon free tier = 100 CU-h/month, every wake burns ~5 min of compute, and
# capping out SUSPENDS the DB until the next cycle. Overnight wakes would spend
# real budget re-rendering rules nobody teaches at 3am; the 2am chain stays the
# night's only DB visitor. Pure code, no model (T0 per model-tiering).
#
# SKIP-not-FAIL: missing env = exit 0 with a SKIP line, per house convention.
#
# EXIT CODE HONESTY (Program 4 follow-up). This script used to end via the
# `tail | mv` log-trim below, so its own exit code was always whatever THAT
# returned — 0, regardless of a FAIL logged above it. bin/run-scheduled.sh now
# wraps this job and records succeeded/failed off the real exit code, so a
# silent-0 exit meant a night this export actually failed would still be
# recorded as succeeded. EXIT_CODE carries the real outcome to the bottom,
# where the script now exits with it explicitly.

  # vault-drift-watch's tamper baseline is refreshed by the NIGHTLY chain, but
  # these three renders move HOURLY here — and they carry an `Exported:`
  # timestamp, so their bytes change on every pass even when no rule changed.
  # The two beats disagreed, so the drift check reported all three as TAMPER
  # ("rewritten outside the nightly export") every day; run 20260813T201608Z is
  # the measured case. The baseline for these paths is derived data, so it is
  # moved by code here, right where the renders move. It merges, so a genuine
  # out-of-band rewrite of any OTHER registered file is still caught tonight.

  # --only-target takes the SAME selector as the export above and resolves it

  # and was wrong immediately: `--only compiled-rules` also matches
  # compiled-rules-gist-index (CLAUDE.md) and compiled-rules-intro
  # (DNA/Network/introduction-rules.md), so the job rewrote five files, the
  # rebaseline covered three, and the next check called the other two TAMPER.
  # One selector, one registry, no hand-kept list to drift.
  # The drift watch is gated behind explicit recovery (Phase 4, 2026-08-22):
  # it reads the legacy vault and has no canonical mode, so it refuses unless
  # the caller says why. This IS an acknowledged legacy-render touch -- it
  # rebaselines the compiled-rules renders this job just rewrote -- so the
  # reason is fixed here rather than left to whoever runs the refresh.
