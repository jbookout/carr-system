# council.sh — THE ONLY SANCTIONED WAY TO CONVENE A COUNCIL.
#
# On 2026-08-09 a council was convened ad hoc with two raw CLI calls. It produced
# good work and it ran GROK AT DEFAULT EFFORT, because nothing said otherwise and
# nothing checked. Joe's instruction that session: councils always run Sol 5.6 at
# high and Grok 4.5 at its top effort.
#
# That requirement is NOT written here as an instruction. Rules 14e0408b,
# e313a3ca and 179be4b8 were all ACTIVE, all recited at session start, and all
# violated the same day — prose does not bind. It is COMPILED IN, in
# bin/council-lib.sh, where a session cannot route around it without editing a
# file. Do not shell out to `codex` or `grok` directly for a council; call this.
#
# Model ids, effort pins, the verification limits and the billing check all live
# in council-lib.sh. Read it before changing anything. The short version: a
# model's self-report of its own name or effort is confabulation, so the manifest
# below records what was REQUESTED and says so.
#
# USAGE
#   bin/council.sh <brief-file> [outdir]
#     Fans the SAME brief, byte-for-byte, to both chairs in parallel. One brief
#     pasted identically is the council contract — the chairs cannot call tools,
#     so each must receive the whole thing.
#   bin/council.sh --check
#     Preflight: CLIs present, model available, effort accepted.
#
# EXIT: 0 both seated · 3 one seated (partial) · 4 none · 2 usage.
# A partial council is reported as partial, never presented as a panel
# (rule 2b889e80: no negative finding from a single collection).
