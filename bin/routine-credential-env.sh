# carr_require_sourceable_db_env CALLER [FILE]
# Refuse to let a caller `source` a credential file the shell cannot parse.
#
# THIS IS FOR THE CALLERS THAT STILL DO `set -a; . db.env`.  They do not want
# carr_load_routine_db_env above — that one is deliberately narrow and loads only
# the keys a routine names, which is the right shape for an unattended job and
# the wrong shape for a script that needs whatever happens to be in the file.
# What those callers DO need is the failure to be legible.
#
# On 2026-08-20 CARR_DB_PROGRAM5_FORWARD_FIX_VERIFIER_URL was written into
# db.env unquoted, from outside tools/rotate-credential.py and its quoting.  Its
# `&channel_binding=require` is a background operator to zsh, so the source died
# on a parse error and took all five keys in the file with it.  Under `set -eu`
# that aborts the caller at rc=126 before it can log anything.  All a session saw
# was `.../db.env:10: parse error near `&'` — text that names neither the script
# it killed nor what that file is for, so bin/migrate-prod.sh, the one sanctioned
# door to production migrations, read as a broken script.
#
# It read as INTERMITTENT too: every one of those callers guards the source on
# NEON_API_KEY being unset, so a caller that already had it exported skipped the
# file and worked.  Aug 26 has both clean applies and a session stuck at the
# source line.
#
# ONE COPY, because a manual path and an automated path that do the same job must
# be the same code (rule a8c55a47) — and seven inlined copies of this is six
# chances for the wording to drift.
#
# `zsh -n` parses and runs NOTHING: no connection, no expansion, no value
# printed.  The probe output is captured and never echoed — zsh quotes a token
# from the offending line and every value in that file is a credential — so only
# the line number is reported.  78 is EX_CONFIG: ran, found no usable credential,
# changed nothing, said so.
