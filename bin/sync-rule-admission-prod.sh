# sync-rule-admission-prod.sh — the ONE sanctioned door for installing the
# reviewed rule-admission contract into the PRODUCTION database.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23). The control-plane roadmap's Phase 1 exit is one
# named test: ops/rule-admission-audit.py passes clean against Production, with
# zero rules in needs_revision and no exception list. On 2026-08-23 that audit
# had never been run against Production by anything. It reported:
#
#   total=218 admitted=4 needs_revision=0 missing=214 incomplete=0
#
# Zero needs_revision, which is the number the roadmap's status section named —
# and 214 active rules with no admission row at all, which it did not. The
# roadmap read "one test owed" and the database read "the contract is very
# nearly unpopulated". Only four rules had ever been admitted, all four through
# the admit-rule verb, one rule at a time.
#
# The cause was the same structural one bin/sync-control-plane-prod.sh names for
# Phase 2: tools/sync-rule-admission.py, the bulk backfill that compiles
# ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json into the admission shape, had no
# production caller. There was no door, so there was no drift to notice —
# production simply never received the contract.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh           # read-only: where does production stand?
#   ./bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh --apply   # backfill, then prove it landed
#
# RAILS, in order:
#   1. An uncommitted enforcement map REFUSES to apply — the map is a REVIEWED
#      inventory and production takes reviewed, committed configuration only.
#      (Read-only runs are always allowed.)
#   2. --apply always re-runs ops/rule-admission-audit.py against production
#      afterwards and takes ITS exit code as the verdict, never the backfill's.
#      The backfill's own output counts what it was asked to write; the audit
#      reads production back (rule a9ecd5b4).
#   3. The backfill REFUSES on any active rule absent from the reviewed map,
#      by design — a rule taught after the map was last extended is a coverage
#      gap, and this door reports it rather than inventing a contract for it.
#   4. Every invocation logs to out/sync-rule-admission-prod.log with outcome.
#   5. The DSN is derived inside this process and never reaches a command line,
#      a terminal or a transcript.
