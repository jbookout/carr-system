#!/bin/zsh
# key-recovery-test.sh — prove the OFFLINE PAPER COPY of the age private key can
# actually recover a backup, using ONLY what is typed in from paper.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Program 4's last unproven backup requirement). Doctrine's exit
# bar is "two encrypted copies with key custody separate from storage" and
# "encryption/key recovery" TESTED, not assumed. bin/restore-rehearse.sh already
# proves the first half — a backup restores — but it reads the key from
# ~/.config/carr/age-key.txt (confirmed 2026-08-02), never from paper. The paper
# copy, written down and stored off this machine the same day, has NEVER been
# exercised. If the Mac dies and the paper copy has a transcription error, every
# backup is unreadable, and the way you find that out is the day you need it.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. ONE command. Prompts Joe to type the key from the PAPER copy
# (never reads the stored file), derives the public key that identity actually
# produces, and compares it to backups-public-key.txt — the repo-tracked,
# encrypt-only public key that is safe to print. That comparison is the DECISIVE
# finding: if it does not match, the paper copy is wrong and nothing else matters,
# so the script stops right there and says exactly what to do. If it matches, it
# hands the typed identity to bin/restore-rehearse.sh — unchanged, untouched, its
# own four production-write guards and its own teardown do the actual restoring —
# so this script proves the recovery loop end to end without reimplementing any
# of the restore.
#
#   ./run.sh key-recovery-test
#
# THE KEY MATERIAL NEVER REACHES A TRANSCRIPT, A LOG, A PROCESS ARGUMENT, OR THE
# REPO. Joe types it (read -s, silent, never echoed). It is written to a 600 file
# in a 700 mktemp dir outside the repo and is passed to every other tool ONLY as
# that file's PATH — never as an argv value, never interpolated into a command
# line. It is shredded (overwrite, then rm -P) on every exit path: normal
# completion, a die(), and Ctrl-C alike. The one thing this script ever prints
# about the key is its DERIVED PUBLIC KEY, which is encrypt-only and cannot
# recover anything — the same class of value backups-public-key.txt already
# carries in the repo. --set-x is never used; no key value is ever echoed.
#
# THE EXIT TRAP TERMINATES EXPLICITLY. A zsh trap registered on INT/TERM runs its
# handler and then, unless the handler calls exit itself, RESUMES the script
# where the signal landed — it does not stop the script on its own. Verified
# empirically while building this: a trap with no explicit exit let a script
# finish an interrupted `sleep` and carry on to its next statement, printing a
# second line and firing the trap a second time. cleanup() below calls
# `exit "$rc"` at its own end for exactly that reason, guarded by an idempotency
# flag so the EXIT trap that call itself triggers cannot shred a second time or
# write a second ops.run row.
