# nightly.sh — the record layer's unattended chain (ORDER 2).
#
# Until this existed, every generated file was only as fresh as the last time a
# human remembered to run the export by hand. Seven steps, in order:
#   1. cadence      (spawn the next_action rows the rules are owed)   [ORDER 14]
#   2. matcher      (availability x open space searches -> digest)    [ORDER 14]
#   3. exports      (all seven targets, LIVE -> the vault)
#   4. corpus push  (doctrine tier: git -> the Drive/vault render copies) [CORPUS FLIP, 2026-08-06]
#   5. consumers    (renewal-feed, lead-board, deal-room — the boards built FROM
#                    those files; they must follow the export that feeds them)
#   6. graph        (derived from the freshly exported files, so it follows too)
#   7. backup       (encrypted pg_dump -> git)
#
# Steps 1 and 2 run BEFORE the exports (ORDER 14d) for one reason: they WRITE,
# and a write that lands after the export it belongs in sits invisible for a
# whole day. Same night, same file.
#
# Step 2 was added by Fable's ORDER 2 addendum. Without it the chain refreshed
# lead-registry.xlsx and panhandle-team-deals.json every night while their boards
# sat unrebuilt, so the façade check reported Lead Board and Deal Room BEHIND
# every single morning — by design, forever. An alarm that fires every day trains
# people to stop reading alarms, which costs more than the two minutes it saves.
#
# Every step runs even if an earlier one failed, and the exit code reports the
# worst outcome. The backup especially must not be skipped because an export
# broke — a bad export is exactly when you want a snapshot of the database.
#
# Appends to out/nightly.log. Verified by OUTPUT freshness (protocol rule 28),
# never by this script existing: tools/health-check.py watches the seven files.

# ── THE DEATH THAT LEFT NO LINE (2026-08-23) ─────────────────────────────────
# On 2026-08-17, 08-18 and 08-19 this chain ran ZERO steps and out/nightly.log
# held nothing to find it by. An unset variable under `set -u` (line 33) does
# not fail a step — it kills the shell where it stands, and the shell's own
# complaint goes to STDERR, which no part of this file was reading. `say` writes
# to the log; the shell writes to fd 2; the two never met. Three nights of no
# cadence, no matcher, no exports, no boards, no graph, no backup, and every
# dead-man check green because the pings are the last step and the chain never
# reached them.
#
# The default a few lines below stops that ONE variable from killing the chain.
# It does nothing for the next unset variable somebody adds, and the failure MODE
# is what made the outage expensive, not the particular name. So this closes the
# mode rather than the instance, in two parts:
#
#   1. THE SHELL'S OWN STDERR IS CAPTURED AND LANDS IN THE LOG. Steps already
#      redirect their own output there; what was never captured is what the
#      chain script itself says when it dies. Captured to a file rather than
#      teed through a co-process on purpose: a `set -u` death is exactly the
#      moment a background tee is least likely to have flushed.
#   2. AN EXIT HANDLER THAT KNOWS WHETHER THE CHAIN FINISHED. CHAIN_OUTCOME is
#      `incomplete` until the completion block at the bottom sets it. Any exit
#      that reaches the handler still holding `incomplete` died mid-run, so the
#      handler names the variable out of the captured stderr, writes the FATAL
#      and completion lines a reader looks for, and FIRES THE CHAIN PING — a
#      night that ran no steps must alarm on the same clock as a night that ran
#      them and failed, not wait out the dead-man grace period.
#
# It also owns the lock release, so the chain has ONE exit path instead of an
# EXIT trap that releases and a separate death that reports nothing. LOCK_HELD
# keeps that safe here, above where bin/run-lock.sh has even been sourced.

#
# That is not hypothetical. It began on 2026-08-17, when the hardening that

# ── TOMBSTONES (2026-08-23, process-audit council R2) ────────────────────────
# How many steps were GATED OUT tonight rather than run. A tombstoned step does
# not execute, so it cannot be OK, SKIP, BLOCKED, TIMEOUT or FAIL — it is a
# fourth thing and it gets its own count.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT JUST A DELETED STEP. On a typical night eleven of these thirty
# steps did no work: six refused for a missing canonical seam, four for an admin
# capability nobody has provisioned here, one was a retired no-op still being
# executed. Every one of them printed its refusal into the log every night for a
# week or more, and this file's own comments call that expected. That is the
# alarm-fatigue failure the chain has now learned three separate times — the
# boards before the ORDER 2 addendum, the mypy tripwire hiding behind an
# already-red row from 08-08 to 08-10, and the fourteen nightly seam refusals
# that made BLOCKED a word people skip. A reader who learns to skip BLOCKED
# skips it on the night it means something.
#
# AND NOT A SILENT DELETION EITHER (rule 1b8e7f43: a blocked action is filed,
# never dropped). Cutting the line would remove the duty along with the noise,
# and nothing would remember the system once owed this. A tombstone IS the file:
# the step does not run, and the log states in one line what is missing and what
# would reopen it. Executing a refusal to produce that sentence was always the
# expensive way to say it — it costs a process launch, a ledger write, a wall
# clock, and a word in the log that also means "something broke".
#
# BUILDING THE MISSING SEAMS IS PRODUCT WORK AND IS NOT IN SCOPE HERE. The
# tombstone records the debt; it does not pay it.

# ── THE JOB-RUN LEDGER (Program 3, 2026-08-14) ───────────────────────────────
# Until this existed, step() computed exactly the right outcome for every step,
# including the SKIP distinction below that nothing else in the system makes,
# and then threw it into a text file on one Mac. A morning question like "which
# step failed, on which code, and what else broke at the same time" could only
# be answered by a human reading out/nightly.log over somebody's shoulder. That
# is the "terminal archaeology" Program 3's gate is named against.
#
# ONE CORRELATION ID PER NIGHT, exported so every step of one chain — and
# anything a step itself records — threads onto the same journey. `ops-record
# trace <id>` then returns the whole night as one chain.
#
# THE RUN KEY IS DERIVED FROM THE LABEL, up to the first parenthesis, so
# "cadence engine (spawn owed next actions)" is always nightly.cadence-engine.
# The parenthetical is where wording actually churns, so keeping it out of the
# key means a reworded step keeps its history. Renaming the leading words DOES
# start a new key, which is the tradeoff taken deliberately rather than changing
# the signature of every call site in a chain that runs unattended tonight.
#
# RECORDING NEVER FAILS A STEP. The recorder's exit code is ignored on purpose.
# It is also not hidden: a step that goes unrecorded makes this service read
# `unknown` on the next health look rather than staying green, because

# and its freshness and stores no health anywhere. Silence is visible by design.

# ── ONE CHAIN AT A TIME (2026-08-14) ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Until this existed, `./bin/nightly.sh` while the scheduled run was mid-flight
# gave you two chains against one database and one vault. The measured cost, on
# 2026-08-14: the second run's vault-drift check read the 30 files the first run
# had just re-exported and reported all 30 as TAMPER. Nothing had been tampered
# with — every quarantined diff was one line, the export timestamp. A drift
# alarm that fires 30 times for a self-inflicted reason is an alarm nobody will
# read on the night it means something.
#
# The false alarm is only the cheap symptom. Two chains also race on the export
# ledger, the encrypted backup, the drift baseline each of them rewrites at the
# end, and the consumer rebuilds — and the loser of any of those races writes a
# file that no longer matches the database it was derived from.
#
# A duplicate run is a NO-OP, not a failure: exit 0, before the dead-man pings,
# so a second run cannot ping /fail for a night the first run is handling fine.
# The traps are here at top level and not inside carr_take_lock because zsh runs
# an EXIT trap set inside a function when the FUNCTION returns — see the header
# of bin/run-lock.sh, where that cost the first cut of this fix.
#
# A HOLDER THAT NEVER LETS GO IS THE OTHER FAILURE, and it is not hypothetical
# either: on 2026-08-23 a stalled holder took three launch attempts and the run
# that finally completed started 76 MINUTES LATE. pid liveness alone cannot see
# that — the stalled process was alive, so every later invocation read a live
# claim and exited 0 as a well-behaved duplicate. The bound in bin/run-lock.sh is
# what turns "alive" into "alive and still plausibly working".
#
# THE TRAPS ARE INSTALLED FAR ABOVE, at the top of the file, and carr_chain_exit
# releases the lock as one of the things it does. That is a change from the two
# bare `carr_release_lock` traps that used to sit right here: a trap installed
# only after the lock is taken cannot report the deaths that happen before it,
# which is every death the 2026-08-17..19 outage consisted of. LOCK_HELD is what
# tells the one handler whether there is yet a lock to release.

# ── PHASE 1 v2 (2026-08-13): vault drift watch --check, FIRST THING THIS CHAIN
# DOES. "install that vault drift watch into the nightly rewrite. That way, the
# first thing it does is check all the drive files" — the design brief for
# this step. It compares the vault's registered/generated files against the
# LAST --rebaseline (taken after last night's exports, see the step at the
# bottom of this chain) so a file tampered with outside the export path is
# caught BEFORE tonight's export would otherwise silently overwrite the
# evidence — the exact gap ops/vault-drift-watch.py's v1 (plain manifest diff)
# could not close. It also flags any UNEXPECTED add/modify/delete of a non-
# registry, non-corpus-mirror .md file. A finding here is loud (exit 2, marks
# this step FAIL, quarantines the file + a diff, appends an intake payload to
# out/vault-drift-salvage-manifest.jsonl) but NEVER aborts the chain — exports
# still have to run and heal the file either way, same "does not abort"
# contract every other step in this chain already has via the step() wrapper
# below. Live routing to /ingest ENABLED 2026-08-13 (Joe: "Let's go ahead and
# do it"): posts each salvage payload as source vault_drift via the token in
# ~/.config/carr/ingest.env (CARR_INGEST_TOKEN_VAULT_DRIFT, Joe-pasted per the
# secrets policy, held in the additive INGEST_TOKENS_EXTRA Worker secret).
# Until that token is pasted on both ends, the POST 401s loudly and the local
# quarantine + salvage manifest still capture everything — fail-visible.
# RECOVERY-POINT CATCH-UP, ahead of every step that could hang.
#
# The chain already survives a step that FAILS: `step` records the bad exit and
# keeps going, so a broken export cannot skip the backup. It does NOT survive a
# step that HANGS — the backup is the last step, so anything that blocks earlier
# takes the backup down with it, wake schedule or no.
#
# Joe accepted a 24-hour recovery point objective on 2026-08-13. That tolerance is
# a contract, and a contract that only holds when nothing hangs is not a contract.
# So: if the newest backup is already older than the objective, take one NOW,
# before the chain risks stalling. The end-of-chain backup still runs and is still
# the authoritative post-write snapshot; this only fires when we are ALREADY out
# of contract, which on a healthy night is never.
# THE RECOVERY POINT IS MEASURED ACROSS BOTH BACKUP PATHS, not just the local
# one. Until 2026-08-21 this block read `ls -t backups/*.sql.age` and nothing
# else, so it saw only the dump taken on this Mac. There are two paths, and
# Program 4 built the second one precisely so the backup of last resort would
# not depend on this machine: .github/workflows/backup-nightly.yml runs the
# SAME bin/backup-dump.sh on GitHub's infrastructure with the same age key.
#
# WHAT THE ONE-PATH VIEW COST, measured the day this changed. The local
# credential was absent, so the newest local dump was 104h old and this block
# announced "objective is 24h" on every run. The cloud workflow had succeeded
# that morning and every morning before it; the true recovery point was about
# twelve hours, well inside the objective. Every local signal said otherwise.
#
# The alarm also pointed at a fix that would have made things worse. The role
# comment in migrations/0119_backup_role.sql is explicit: the backup credential
# is held "never on Joe's Mac and never in this repo". Adding it locally to
# quiet this line would have put the credential on the exact machine the second
# path exists to be independent of.
#
# ops/recovery-point.py keeps UNKNOWN separate from STALE, which is the whole
# reason it is a script rather than another line of shell here: a path that
# could not be read is not a path that reported a gap, and collapsing the two
# is how a false alarm gets built in the first place.

# VAULT DRIFT WATCH RETIRED, both ends — nothing writes to the vault to drift.

# could be clobbered between runs. It watches tracked .md files under the vault.
# The 2026-08-19 cutoff retired those renders and this chain no longer writes
# there at all, so the watch guards a surface with no writers and no files. The
# script and its manifests stay for the recovery envelope.

# SCHEMA SNAPSHOT DRIFT, added 2026-08-13 with the snapshot itself. db/schema.sql
# is now what builds staging AND what CI's migration check applies pending
# migrations on top of. If production's structure moves and the committed file
# does not, both of those keep passing against a shape that no longer exists —
# a green check measuring the wrong database, which is the failure mode this
# whole session kept finding. It runs HERE and not in CI because it needs
# production, and CI cannot reach production by construction.

# one carrying P0-1's release object. It surfaced when a person went to run an
# acceptance test there and got "relation ops.release does not exist" — six days
# after the drift began. The gate's assertions 5 and 6 are that discovery turned
# into a question the machine asks every night, in both directions.
#
# It runs HERE, not in CI, for the same reason: it needs the two REAL Neon
# projects, and CI reaches neither by construction. It writes to neither, and
# opens production read-only at the session level rather than merely intending

# quarterly CMS provider-enrolment extract a person downloads; build-license-pool
# .py consumes a licensing file filtered in browser memory so the raw statewide
# file never touches disk. Both DELETE their input immediately after running,
# because it is identifiable data about real practitioners. That discard rule is
# a privacy control somebody chose, not an oversight to automate around.
#

# only ever as fresh as the last time a human remembered to run them by hand.
# Both read the freshly EXPORTED vault files (section-index walks the vault
# tree; the system graph's folder-to-folder edges come from file text) AND the
# doctrine STORE (both take the lib/record_sources store pass this Mac's venv
# can reach), so they must run AFTER the exports step and AFTER the corpus push
# above (git-canonical doctrine -> vault) — running earlier would index/graph
# yesterday's vault content. Placed here, late in the chain and right after the
# Obsidian graph render, rather than any earlier: they also want the record
# layer to have finished its own writes and reads for the night (cadence,
# matcher, cutover readiness, consumers), and there is nothing downstream of
# them in-chain that reads their output before the backup, so their exact slot
# among the late steps is not load-bearing — only "after exports+corpus push,
# before backup" is. Same $PY venv convention as every other DB-touching step
# (run.sh's own graph_system/section_index functions already use $PY, not
# plain python3, for the same psycopg reason as ORDER 29a).
# NOT A DRIVE PROJECTION ANY MORE, and it had not been one for some time. The
# builder reads the doctrine store and writes out/section-index.tsv inside this
# repository; it names no Drive root and calls no recovery boundary that could
# refuse for want of one. Exercised on the normal path 2026-08-22: 137 files

# mechanism, v_vendor_level_suggestion. That view has existed since migration
# 0052 and NOTHING has ever read it: a finding that only lives in a record has
# not reached the partner (rule d8c9b1f0). This step reads it and prints the
# disagreements. It changes no level: the level stays a human judgment, stored

# CAPTURED HERE, ON THE NEXT LINE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (fixed 2026-08-23).
# This assignment used to sit at the bottom of the portability mirror below, so
# `HC_BACKUP_RC` — the value the "backup" dead-man check is pinged with — carried
# the MIRROR's exit code and not the backup's. Two different steps: one dumps and
# encrypts the database, the other renders markdown and csv.
#
# WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE COST. A backup that FAILED while the mirror succeeded
# pinged the backup check OK. That is the 2026-08-07 corrupt-backup defect
# exactly — "a success signal that does not look at the thing it reports on is
# worse than no signal, because it is believed" — reintroduced one variable over,
# and hidden because on this Mac both steps happen to SKIP for the same absent
# credential, so the wrong answer and the right answer have been identical.
#
# LAST_STEP_RC is overwritten by every step() call, so the only safe place to
# read it is immediately after the step you mean. ops/nightly-tombstone-selftest.py
# replays this region with a fake step() and asserts that the value reaching the
# ping is the backup's, wherever this assignment happens to sit.
BACKUP_RC=$LAST_STEP_RC
# The portability mirror (Joe's ruling 2026-08-08): the readable escape hatch —
# md per doctrine doc + CSV per table, Drive + local disk, wholesale overwrite.
# NO GUARD HERE. #391 wrapped this in `if [ -n "$CARR_DB_BACKUP_URL" ]` because
# an empty DATABASE_URL used to make doctrine_mirror.py exit 2, which reads as
# FAIL. #387 fixed that in the callee on the same day: the mirror now returns
# 78 on an absent credential, the house SKIP contract, exactly as
# bin/backup-dump.sh already did. Both landed within an hour of each other and
# nobody noticed they overlapped.
#
# The callee is the right home for it. A guard here protects one caller; 78
# protects every caller, including anyone who runs the mirror by hand. Keeping
# both meant two places to read before you could answer what happens when the
# credential is missing, and the shell branch would go stale the moment the
# exit code changed again. ops/nightly-capability-skip-selftest.py asserts the
# behaviour against the mirror itself rather than against this line.
# THE PORTABILITY MIRROR HAS A DESTINATION AGAIN (Joe's ruling, 2026-08-22):
# CARR OneDrive, the same home the six business exports were given.
#
# It wrote to two places and only one of them died. The second copy, under this
# repository's out/mirror, never stopped working; the first pointed at the Drive
# vault the 2026-08-19 cutoff retired, so the step refused and BOTH copies
# stopped being written. That is worth naming: a step with a live half and a
# dead half fails whole, and the live half goes quiet without anyone deciding it
# should.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR, which is why it earns an offsite home rather than a repo path.
# It renders the doctrine database as plain markdown and csv with a manifest —
# the copy a person can still read if Postgres is unreachable and the record
# layer cannot answer. A portability mirror that exists only on the machine that
# would be lost is not portability.
#
# ONE DEFINITION OF WHERE JOE'S FILES LIVE. The root comes from the same
# variable the exporters read (exporters/common.py), so the destination is
# stated once and this step follows it. Hard-coding the path again would recreate
# the two-homes problem in the same week it was removed.
# The default is a plain assignment rather than an inline ${VAR:-default}: the
# path contains an apostrophe in "Joe's Folder", and inside a parameter
# expansion the shell processes quotes, so that apostrophe opens a quoted run
# and swallows the rest of the file. It parsed as an unmatched brace 200 lines
# later, which is a long way from the cause.

# HISTORY, and the diff surfaces in this chain's own backup commit rather than by
# failing the chain every time Joe approves a permission interactively. The
# printed diff lands in nightly.log either way. Direction is Drive -> repo (the
# opposite of sync-skills.sh) because Claude Code itself writes these files.

# Added 2026-08-02 (cold-session audit): the smoke canary runs IN the chain and records
# its own heartbeat. Before this it sat in the dead-man freshness list with NOTHING
# writing to it, so it read stale from 7/30 onward while passing 17/17 every time anyone
# ran it by hand — a canary whose silence was indistinguishable from its health.
#
# REPLACED 2026-08-04 (loop #178, Joe's ruling). smoke-and-record.sh runs
# mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh, which authenticates to /mcp with the legacy
# PARTNER_TOKENS bearer. That auth path was retired on purpose (5b13ed7,
# 2026-08-03), so the suite has returned 23 failed / 0 passed every night since —
# a canary that is not merely silent but structurally dead, and whose red had
# already become background noise in one day.
#
# Joe ruled against minting a machine credential to revive it, since that would
# partly undo a deliberate retirement. So the chain now runs what it CAN verify
# without a partner identity: the Worker is deployed and still refuses anonymous
# callers, and all 40 v_* views the read verbs sit on are queryable — which is
# the failure that actually bites, because migrations break views and sixteen
# landed in one day on 2026-08-02.
#
# THE FULL VERB SUITE IS NOT DEAD, IT MOVED: run ./mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh

# still covers transport, dispatch and answer correctness, and this probe says so
# in its own output rather than letting a green row imply more than it proves.

# ── THE FULL VERB SUITE IS BACK IN THE CHAIN, 2026-08-14 (Program 3) ──────────
# The paragraph above is now HISTORY rather than current instruction, and is kept
# because the reasoning is the load-bearing part. What changed: the credential
# whose retirement forced the 2026-08-04 removal has been replaced by a narrower
# one (PROBE_TOKENS -> a locked 'probe' profile, loop #192), it is provisioned,
# and the suite was verified honestly green — 33 passed, 0 failed, three
# profile-locked SKIPs — BEFORE this line was added. All three failures found on
# the way there were fixture drift, not regressions; the system answered
# correctly in every case. See bin/smoke-and-record.sh for the whole account.
#
# It runs AFTER the verb probe rather than instead of it. The two cover different
# failures and the cheap one should not be gated behind the expensive one: the
# probe needs no credential and sweeps all 40 views, while this suite needs the
# probe token and covers transport, dispatch and ANSWER CORRECTNESS — the class
# where a verb responds 200 with a wrong answer, which no view sweep can see.
#
# A MISSING TOKEN IS A SKIP, A REFUSED TOKEN IS AN ALARM. smoke-and-record.sh
# maps "no token configured" to 78 so an absent credential cannot alarm every
# night until someone pastes one — that pattern is how this suite was lost the
# first time. A token that EXISTS and is refused stays a failure, because it
# means post-deploy verification has silently stopped happening.

# tomorrow's first-thing --check (top of this file) compares against: a
# registered file whose hash differs from tonight's rebaseline was touched
# OUTSIDE this chain, which is exactly the "system rewrites every file, so

# layer down. This step used to run unconditionally, so the exports check and the
# backup check were pinged OK on the strength of the chain REACHING them, never
# on what they did. On 2026-08-07 a 200-byte corrupt backup pinged the backup
# check as healthy. A success signal that does not look at the thing it reports
# on is worse than no signal, because it is believed.
#
# Each check now gets the exit code of the step it is named after. hc-ping.sh
# pings /fail on anything non-zero, so a bad night ALARMS IMMEDIATELY instead of
# waiting out the dead-man grace period — the same treatment the Worker health
# check has had since ORDER 5. Exported rather than prefixed onto the call for
# the zsh scoping reason stated at CARR_EXPORT_LIVE above.

# prefix of it. The pings stay ahead of it because a dead-man alarm must not wait
# on anything that touches the database.
#
# WHY IT IS A STEP AND NOT A TAIL COMMAND: a step() call records ITSELF to the
# ledger, so an assess that starts failing is visible the same way every other
# step is. An assessment nobody assesses is the blind spot this whole program
# exists to remove.
#
# It opens an incident for each job whose LATEST run failed, appends a fact to
# one that is already open rather than raising a second, and moves an incident to
# monitoring when its job starts passing again. It cannot close one — the grant
# withholds resolved_at, so only a human declares an incident resolved (0117).

# "watch until 24h clear, then close with an outcome", and until 2026-08-14
# nothing performed the close: assess only moves a recovered incident INTO
# monitoring, and no job, agent or service entry called a close path, because
# none existed. The windows expired and the pile stayed, reprinted in full every
# night — a list that can only grow teaches people to stop reading it, the same
# way a check that goes red on normal work does.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not close on one green run, which is the thing
# 0117's grant was written to prevent. It closes only what has nothing left to
# decide: recovered against real evidence, window fully elapsed, and NO failure
# recorded against that same service/environment/run_key for the whole window.
# Anything still flapping, never recovered, or missing evidence stays open and
# keeps its human outcome — that is what `ops-record.py resolve` is for.
#
# WHY BREAK-GLASS. carr_jobs cannot write resolved_at or root_cause at all
# (0117's column-scoped grant), so this needs the owner credential, and db-tap
# holds every write behind default_transaction_read_only unless break-glass is
# set. The reason is stated here rather than typed fresh each night, and every
# run appends to out/break-glass-receipts.log, so the escalation is auditable
# instead of invisible.
