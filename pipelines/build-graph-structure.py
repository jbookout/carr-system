build-graph-structure.py — the SKELETON of the people graph.
(Replaces build-graph-hubs.py, which emitted flat attribute tags with no hierarchy.)

THE MODEL (Joe, 2026-07-25 — this is the spec, quoted):
  "LEADS all in one web, connected to PROSPECTS all in one web, connected to
   DEALS all in one web. On the sides you'd have DELL connected to his leads,
   prospects and deals, and JOE connected to his. VENDORS connected to the leads,
   prospects and deals that they are involved with. The Lead Board connected to
   all the leads that are sitting in the board."

        ⚑ sources ──▶ ① LEADS ──▶ ② CLIENTS & PROSPECTS ──▶ ③ DEALS
                          ▲               ▲                    ▲
        ★ JOE ────────────┴───────────────┴────────────────────┤
        ★ DELL ───────────┴───────────────┴────────────────────┘
                                 ◆ VENDORS ─┘

WHAT WENT WRONG IN v1, so it is not repeated
  v1 emitted flat attribute hubs (Firm, Market, Owner, Category…) with no
  hierarchy. The two Owner hubs pulled 493 edges and rendered as two giant stars
  with nothing to give them shape — a hairball. The fix applied then was to
  DELETE the owner hubs. That was wrong: owner poles are wanted. The real defect
  was the MISSING BACKBONE. With stage nodes present, an owner pole reads as a
  pole because every record also belongs to a stage, so the layout has two axes
  instead of one.

  Kept from v1: taxonomy buckets (Category, 47 members of "Banker/Lender") stay
  out — they are labels, not structure. Firm and source clusters stay in, capped,
  because they are small and they say something. Deal lane stays out: it is
  already colour.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE: writes only to Graph/hubs/. Never edits the entity notes.
