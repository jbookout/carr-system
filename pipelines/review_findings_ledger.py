"""review_findings_ledger.py — carry-forward of code-review findings across
the commits of one pull request, and the disposition each one ends with.

WHY THIS EXISTS. engineering-workflow-sop section 15 ("The continuous loop"
and "The findings ledger"): on a PR that receives new commits, fixed findings
resolve, unresolved findings carry forward, and the review never restarts
from scratch; every finding ends with a disposition (fixed, dismissed with
reason, accepted risk). Before this module, council rows were bound to one
commit and no later request read them. Open loop 676 tracks the build.

THE STORAGE CHOICE, decided 2026-09-30 before any code and confirmed by Jev
(ask-jev receipt 53fd096e-06dc-4301-b4f3-39942ca42e76, storage ->
b_append_disposition_row at 1.0, read source -> r1_inline_in_request at 0.93):

  (a) an existing verb that updates a finding's status: NONE EXISTS. record_flag
      is append-only; no verb sets a status on an existing row.
  (b) CHOSEN. Each disposition is a NEW record-finding row, kind
      "code_review_disposition", filed against the commit under review, whose
      value names the prior finding (flag_id + index + commit). record-finding
      already documents this use: "Set disputed/superseded when filing against
      an earlier finding." No new verb, schema change, migration or deploy.
      The latest disposition row per (prior flag_id, index) is the finding's
      current state.
  (c) a new verb or migration: not needed for storage.

THE READ SIDE. No deployed verb reads v_code_finding or any record_flag value,
and the runner talks to the Worker only through the reviewer bearers. So the
REQUEST carries the prior findings inline (see validate_carry_forward), each
naming the record-layer flag_id of the review row it came from, and the caller
(the orchestrator) supplies them — flatten_review_findings() turns a recorded
review into that shape. When a read verb over v_code_finding ships, the source
swaps without touching the prompt or the disposition path.

THE PRIOR-FINDING SHAPE (one entry per finding, not per review row):
  flag_id             REQUIRED uuid: the record-finding row the finding sits in
  commit_sha          REQUIRED sha: that row's commit; must be in prior_commits
  index               REQUIRED int >= 0: position in that row's review.findings
  title               REQUIRED non-empty string
  severity            REQUIRED blocker | major | minor | nit
  detail, location    optional strings (location may be null)
  reviewer            optional string: which seat raised it
  ledger_disposition  optional {disposition, reason}: the latest disposition
                      already on the record. fixed, dismissed and accepted_risk
                      are CLOSED — the finding is not re-raised and not
                      re-recorded. still_present (or absent) is OPEN.

Stdlib only, like the runner.
