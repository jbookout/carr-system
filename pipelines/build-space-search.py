build-space-search.py — CARR client-facing space-search report generator.

Reads a normalized properties.json (schema v1, see DNA/Deal Management/space-search-sop.md)
and emits ONE self-contained HTML file: CARR brand fonts, logo, and photos all inlined as
data URIs, no external requests, works offline and as an email attachment.

Source-agnostic by design. CoStar, Moody's/Catylist, Crexi, and ECAR all normalize into the
same record shape, so the report looks identical no matter which platform supplied a field.
That consistency is the whole point of generating our own detail sheets instead of stapling
four different MLS PDF formats together.

HARD RULE: no listing-agent or brokerage contact information EVER reaches a client-facing
report (Joe, 2026-07-22). Broker data lives in the internal xlsx only. This generator has no
code path that renders it — the normalized schema simply has no field for it.

Usage:
    python3 build-space-search.py <search-folder>

Expects inside that folder:
    properties.json          the normalized records
    photos/<file>.jpg        any photos referenced by a record's "photo" key (optional)

Writes:
    <client-slug>-space-search-<date>.html

# PURCHASE / INVESTMENT SUPPORT (added 2026-07-31, Le C-063 30/70 search)
#
# The generator was lease-only: every headline figure was rent per square foot
# per year. An owner-occupier or investment BUY answers different questions --
# what does it cost, what does it yield, who is in it, and how much of it can
# the client actually occupy -- so a purchase record carries a "sale" block and
# these renderers run instead of the rate ones.
#
# ADDITIVE BY DESIGN. Nothing fires unless a record carries "sale", so every
# existing lease search still renders byte for byte. Verified against Hughes.
