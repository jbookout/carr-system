build-search-map.py — a static, self-contained map for a CARR space search.

Geocodes every property in a search folder's properties.json, fetches the
OpenStreetMap tiles covering them, stitches those tiles into one image, and
writes map.json holding the image as a data URI plus the pixel position of each
pin. build-space-search.py picks that up and renders the map into the report.

Why build it this way rather than embedding a map library:
  - The report has to work offline and as an email attachment. A Leaflet or
    Mapbox map needs a network at open time, and a strict reader or a printed
    page gets a blank rectangle where the map should be.
  - No external requests at view time means no tracking of the client either.
  - It prints. A stitched raster prints exactly as it looks on screen.

The pins are positioned with the same Web Mercator maths OSM uses, so they land
where they belong on the stitched raster.

⚠️ OpenStreetMap requires attribution wherever this image is shown, and their
tile usage policy asks for a real User-Agent and no bulk scraping. One search is
a few dozen tiles, well inside the policy. Geocoding through Nominatim is capped
at one request per second, which this script honours.

Usage:  python3 build-search-map.py <search-folder>
