diff-salesforce-deals.py — reconcile the Salesforce capture against the deal record.

Salesforce report export is DISABLED on Joe's profile, so the capture step is a
browser read (see DNA/Deal Management/salesforce-read-sop.md). That step writes
Automation/salesforce-deals-latest.tsv. THIS script is the deterministic half:
it diffs that capture against the deal record and prints exactly what changed.

READ SIDE (ORDER 29b, repointed from panhandle-team-deals.json): records mode is
the default and reads the deal record live through lib/record_sources.py's
load_deals_doc(), the same read build-deal-room.py and graph-health.py already
use (ORDER 29a). Records mode falls back to files, loudly on stderr, when there
is no exporter credential or psycopg is not importable (a plain `python3`, a
machine with no db.env) — see lib/record_sources.py's effective_mode(). Pass
--files to force the file read on purpose; panhandle-team-deals.json is still
generated nightly and is still the only path Dell's runtime and any machine
without a database credential can use.

WRITE SIDE: it never guesses and never writes anything unless --apply is passed.
  --files mode   unchanged: --apply still hand-writes the phase/city/lane fields
                 into panhandle-team-deals.json, the documented fallback path.
  --records mode panhandle-team-deals.json is now a GENERATED EXPORT of the
                 record layer (nightly). A hand-write to it here would be
                 overwritten by the next export and look applied, then silently
                 vanish. --apply therefore REFUSES to write anything in records
                 mode: it prints the exact changes found and the record-verb
                 calls (update-deal) a session should run instead, so a human or
                 a session can execute them deliberately. This script does not
                 write to the database; it never has and still does not.

Lane truth: Salesforce's own "Out of Market Deal" checkbox (the `oom` column,
N/T), NOT a city-string heuristic. A deal's lane decides the economics:
  T (territory)  — CARR represents:            Dell 70% / Joe 30%
  N (out-of-market) — referred to a local CARR agent: agent 70% / Dell 21% / Joe 9%
(verified 2026-07-25 against Salesforce Deal Splits on Trambadia and Nikki Cottis)

Usage:
  python3 diff-salesforce-deals.py [CARR_ROOT]                       # report only, records mode
  python3 diff-salesforce-deals.py [CARR_ROOT] --files                # report only, file mode
  python3 diff-salesforce-deals.py [CARR_ROOT] --apply                # records mode: refuses, prints the update-deal calls
  python3 diff-salesforce-deals.py [CARR_ROOT] --files --apply        # file mode: writes panhandle-team-deals.json (fallback path)
