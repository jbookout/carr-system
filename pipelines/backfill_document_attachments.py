backfill_document_attachments.py — ORDER 20(a). The archive rows ORDER 13 owed.

WHAT WAS OWED AND WHY. ORDER 13's factory produced real files for C-112 and
filed them in Joe's OneDrive deal folder, but R2 was not enabled on the account
that afternoon, and `attachment.r2_key` is `not null unique` in 0001. An
attachment row with a null key is not insertable, and faking the key with a
local path would have put a lie in the record layer, so the rows were left
explicitly owed. Joe enabled R2 the same evening and the bucket now exists. This
script pays the debt for every document row already prepared.

WHAT IT DOES, per document row that is missing an attachment:
  1. reconstruct the file names the factory produced (the verb's own basename
     grammar: <deal name>-<template name>-DRAFT-MM-DD-YYYY, safe-cased), and
     look for them in the deal's OneDrive folder first, then in out/documents/.
  2. hash what it finds, upload it to R2 UNDER THE QUOTA GUARD, insert the
     attachment row, point document.working_attachment / pdf_attachment at it.
  3. patch the document note and write one event per document.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It does not re-render anything: if the file is not on
disk, the row is reported as unrecoverable and left alone, because a document
row whose bytes are gone is a fact worth seeing, not a reason to invent a new
draft with today's records. It never deletes. It never uploads past the quota
(see lib/r2_archive.py); a refusal leaves the row owed with the reason recorded.

Needs an owner or writer DSN in DATABASE_URL. `carr_jobs` cannot read
doc_template or attachment at all, by design, so this is not a jobs-tier job.
