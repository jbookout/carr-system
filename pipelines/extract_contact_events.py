"""Extract REAL, DATED contact events out of narrative already in the database.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES (capture-problem-2026-08-02.md §4, Option B). The system
records what happened as prose, and every mechanism that consumes it — staleness,
reciprocity, the client graph, delivery scoring — needs events. Production holds
125 `analysis` rows and 77 `note` rows of excellent narrative and exactly ONE
contact row. The touches are in there; they are sentences, not rows.

    "Addendum, 2026-07-30: lease-terms call. Client says..."   <- a real call,
    on a real date, currently queryable by nobody.

WHAT IT DOES. Splits every analysis/note row's summary+detail into sentences,
matches each against a table of COMPLETED contact patterns, and emits a proper
contact activity row (kind from activity_kind where is_contact) attached to the
SAME subject the source row was attached to.

THE STOP RULES, IN CODE (the ORDER 43 lesson: a confidently wrong date is worse
than a missing one):

  * NO DATE IS EVER INFERRED. A sentence must carry an explicit date — ISO
    2026-07-30, "Jul 30, 2026", or 7/30/26. A BARE 7/30 is accepted only when the
    source row itself establishes exactly one year (see year_context): every ISO
    date in that row agrees on a year AND that year matches the row's own
    occurred_at. If the row does not settle the year, the bare date is NOT
    guessed — the event goes to the review list.
  * INTENTIONS ARE NOT TOUCHES. "planning to call", "should reach out", "call
    Monday to confirm", "awaiting", "next step" — excluded, counted, sampled in
    the report. So are negations ("there was no separate 7/20 call", "the LOI
    never went out").
  * FUTURE-DATED EVENTS ARE NOT EVENTS. A touch dated after the record that
    describes it is a plan someone wrote down. Excluded to the review list rather
    than imported.
  * NO ROW IS EVER DELETED OR EDITED. This importer only inserts.

WHAT RIDES ON THE ROW so a human can audit every extraction later:
  summary — the source sentence VERBATIM. Not a paraphrase, not a rewrite.
  detail  — an audit block: source activity id, the pattern that matched, the
            date token as it appeared, and how the year was established.
  source  — 'import_extracted'. Distinct from 'stated' (a human said this just
            now), 'import' (a ledger entry moved wholesale) and
            'import_extracted' (a machine read a sentence and made a claim).
  actor   — the human the SENTENCE names, if it names exactly one; otherwise the
            source row's own actor. Never guessed between two candidates.

IDEMPOTENT by record_source(source_system, external_key), the import_wave1 /
import_md_ledgers pattern and the same UNIQUE constraint. external_key is
`extract:<source_activity_id>:<n>` — stable, human-legible, unique per extraction.
A rerun writes 0 rows.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. --apply writes. Run through db-tap so no DSN reaches a shell:

    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py run pipelines/extract_contact_events.py
    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py --branch rehearse-extract run \
        pipelines/extract_contact_events.py --apply --rehearse

--apply against PRODUCTION is the supervisor's tap, not this script's habit.
--rehearse proves it is pointed at a branch rather than trusting the caller.
