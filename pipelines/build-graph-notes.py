build-graph-notes.py — derived Obsidian graph notes for the CARR AI vault.

Emits one small .md note per entity into <vault>/Graph/ so Obsidian's graph
shows the REAL system: vendors, worked leads, clients, deals — with every
relationship the data actually encodes rendered as a [[wikilink]] edge.
DERIVED VIEW: regenerate any time; never hand-edit Graph/. The truth is the
record layer (v_export_vendors / v_export_leads / v_export_clients /
v_export_deals), read live by default since ORDER 29a; the four generated files
(vendors.xlsx, lead-registry.xlsx, client-roster.xlsx, panhandle-team-deals.json)
are the same data exported, and `--files` still builds the graph from them.

Design bar (Joe, 2026-07-24): complete and truthful, legible via the semantic
palette (graph color groups live in .obsidian/graph.json, keyed to the tags
written here). Anomalies are the point: a vendor with no edges never referred;
a floating lead has no source; an unlinked referral string matched nobody.

Identity rule: edges link on exact IDs (V-###, C-###, L-###) or exact
case-insensitive full-name/company match ONLY. A partial or surname match is
never linked (standing rule: a lone surname never merges records) — the
unlinked text stays visible in the note as a "(no exact match)" line.

# [loop #133] THE TWO PARTNERS ARE NODES OF THIS GRAPH, not just owner colours.
#
# THE DEFECT. v_party_graph held 31 edges and this script drew 24. Six of the
# seven it dropped were Joe's own `can_introduce` edges — Heather Lavallo,
# Josh Durst, Bruce Pardington, Justin Gay, Katherine Wilborn, Gary Tringas — so
# 100% of the "Joe can introduce you to X" class, which is the single most
# valuable edge class in the referral engine, was missing from the one surface
# built to show relationships. Joe is party P-1084 and carries no client, lead or
# vendor row (correctly — he is the agent, not his own prospect), so
# v_party_graph resolves his endpoint to NULL and the ref_node map below, built
# only from V-/C-/L- ids, could never contain him.
#
# WHY THE NAMES ARE HARDCODED, since that deserves an answer. The record layer
# has no partner flag: `actor` knows who Joe and Dell are, but carr_reader and
# carr_exporter have no grant on it, and there is nothing on party.kind that
# separates an agent from any other person. Two names in one constant, resolved
# against v_ref_index at run time and reported if they do not resolve, is honest
# about that; inventing a heuristic ("whoever sources the most can_introduce
# edges") would be a guess wearing the costume of a rule. When the record layer
# grows a real partner marker, read it here and delete this list.
#
# BOTH PARTNERS GET A NODE EVEN WITH ZERO EDGES. Dell has no logged intro edges
# today, and his node rendering as an isolated dot is the correct picture — it
# says his side of the network is uncaptured, which is exactly the class of
# anomaly the design bar above asks this graph to show.

# disagree about which record represents a person. One real lead is the live

# so the intro that matters (a vendor reaching a CLIENT) drew no line at all.

# rows keyed by ref, so the mapping is ref -> the node title this script just
# wrote. No name matching, no partial matching, no surname anywhere. An endpoint
# whose ref names no node in Graph/ is COUNTED AND NAMED, never dropped quietly —
# an intro path that silently vanishes from the picture is worse than one the
# picture admits it cannot draw.

# The edges are appended AFTER every note exists, because an edge can point at a
# lead or a client whose node had not been minted when its own note was written.
