# build-front-door.py — self-contained generator for The Front Door (DNA/Team/front-door.html)
# Regenerate: python3 build-front-door.py  (writes front-door.html beside it). Edit the GROUPS list to change tiles.
# Mirrors the lead board's build-lead-board.py pattern so the Front Door is regenerable, not hand-edited.

For a genuinely new person, CALL add-party(idempotency_key,name) and read its returned party_id; never continue on needs_confirm. Then, for a lead, CALL new-lead(idempotency_key,party_id,stage). For an active client, CALL new-client(idempotency_key,party_id,status,acquisition_source,research_evidence). Use a fresh idempotency_key for each intended write. Owner is derived by the server from the authenticated actor; never ask for or pass owner. If the selected verb cannot represent the intake, name the missing intake seam and stop.",
    "New Vendor": "Gather name, category, category ref code, stage, territory, and source one at a time. CALL find(query) first. If it resolves one live party, use that returned party_id. For a genuinely new person or organization, CALL add-party(idempotency_key,name) and read its returned party_id; never continue on needs_confirm. CALL new-vendor(idempotency_key,party_id,category,ref_code,stage,research_evidence) with a fresh idempotency_key. Owner is derived by the server from the authenticated actor; never ask for or pass owner. new-vendor does not accept territory: only when territory was supplied, read the freshly created vendor and its version, then CALL update-vendor(idempotency_key,vendor,base_version,fields) with fields containing only territory and a different fresh idempotency_key. Stop if a fresh base_version is unavailable.",
    "Log My Day": "Debrief the day one item at a time. Use find before naming a record; use log-activity for meetings, introductions, and relationship events, add-deal-note or set-next-action for deal facts, and add-loop only for genuinely blocked work. Name any item whose record verb is missing instead of filing it elsewhere.",
    "New Idea": "Ask for the idea and why it matters, then CALL add-loop(idempotency_key,kind,owner,body) with kind idea and owner Joe. If it is actionable work rather than an idea, apply the deferral gate before using add-loop; do not create an inbox file.",
    "Log an Event": "Read the introduction-rules doctrine with search-doctrine and read-doctrine. Gather event type, hosts, date, cost, attendees, and outcomes one at a time. Resolve hosts with find and record the event through log-activity. Stop on any attendee or relationship you cannot resolve; never write an event log file.",
    "Import a List": "Ask me to attach the list and give its source. Preview and deduplicate each person with find. The front door has no approved bulk contact-list importer: name that canonical import seam as unavailable and stop after the reviewed preview; do not claim an import or write registry/vendor files.",
    "File a Comp": "Gather the real deal terms and their source one at a time. There is no canonical comp-write verb exposed at this front door: name the comp-ingress seam as unavailable and stop with a structured preview; do not write a comp row or file.",
    "Teach a Rule": "Read applicable doctrine with search-doctrine and read-doctrine, then ask for the exact statement in Joe's words. CALL teach(idempotency_key,statement,human_quote) first and read the returned proposed rule_id. Inspect the authoritative response: if it does not supply the exact installed policy_kind and control_keys for that rule, report pending seam: exact installed control contract unavailable, and stop. If and only if it supplies both, CALL approve-rule(idempotency_key,rule_id,policy_kind,control_keys,reason). Never invent controls, skip teach, or fabricate activation.",
    "Vendor to Vendor Match": "Resolve the target vendor with find, use who-do-we-know for relationship paths, and read introduction rules with the doctrine verbs. Present only evidence-backed compatible pairs and apply the politics block; this is advisory and writes nothing.",
    "Vendor to Client Match": "Resolve the named client or vendor with find-and-catch-up, read the matching doctrine with doctrine verbs, and use who-do-we-know for relationship evidence. Present an evidence-backed match only; this is advisory and writes nothing.",
    "Build a Tour Packet": "Ask for the client, market, criteria, and approved properties one at a time. Resolve the client with find-and-catch-up and read the tour doctrine through doctrine verbs. Use prepare-document only if a registered tour-packet template exists; otherwise name the missing document-template seam and stop.",
    "Deal Comparison": "Ask for the comparison type and source documents, resolve the client/deal with find-and-catch-up, and read the comparison doctrine through doctrine verbs. Use prepare-document only with a registered matching template; otherwise name the missing template seam and stop. Reconcile every displayed number to its source.",
    "Draft an LOI": "Resolve the client and deal with find-and-catch-up, read negotiation, lease-review, and writing doctrine through doctrine verbs, then gather terms one at a time. Use prepare-document only with a registered LOI template; otherwise name the missing template seam and stop. Draft only; never send.",
    "Renewal Workup": "Resolve the client and deal with find-and-catch-up, read renewal and lease-estimator doctrine through doctrine verbs, and gather current terms one at a time. Use prepare-document only with a registered renewal-comparison template; otherwise name the missing template seam and stop. Label estimates and reconcile outputs.",
    "Deal One-Pager": "Resolve the client/deal with find-and-catch-up and read the comparison doctrine through doctrine verbs. Use prepare-document only with a registered purchase-vs-lease one-page template and verified source numbers; otherwise name the missing template seam and stop.",
    "What's Waiting On Me": "Call today-triage and work from its returned records only. Present the single oldest actionable item first. Use complete-action, set-next-action, triage-item, promote-pool, or decline-candidate only when that exact returned item and Joe's answer fit the verb; then read back the result before continuing.",
    "Write a Post": "Ask for topic, platform, and angle one at a time. Use the write-content skill and doctrine verbs for voice rules. Produce a draft and graphic for review; do not publish or invent a substance-bank write.",
    "Audit Writing": "Ask for the text, read writing doctrine through search-doctrine and read-doctrine, and provide review-only findings. Do not rewrite or write a record unless asked.",
    "Research a Market": "Ask for market and scope, then perform sourced research and verify each claim. Use record-finding only for evidence that belongs to an existing resolved record; there is no general market-report write verb, so name that seam and return the sourced result without claiming it was saved.",
    "Who Do We Know": "Ask for the target, resolve it with find, and call who-do-we-know. Read introduction rules with doctrine verbs and apply the politics check before presenting paths. This is read-only.",
    "Hand to Dell": "Ask for the handoff and what it unblocks, then use add-loop with kind team_loop and owner Dell. Read the created loop back before confirming; never write a team-board row.",
    "Prep for a Meeting": "Ask who, when, and purpose. Resolve the person with find-and-catch-up, then call prepare-conversation. Use the returned records and doctrine verbs only; produce a concise brief and do not claim a file was created.",
    "Draft a Follow-Up": "Resolve the lead with find-and-catch-up, read outreach and writing doctrine with doctrine verbs, and ask whether they replied. Draft the next touch only from returned history. Never send; log-outreach is used only after Joe actually sends.",
    "Open the Dashboard": "Call today-triage, deal-room-board, and loop-board, then show a compact live summary from those returned records. Do not rebuild or open a legacy dashboard file.",
    "Open the Lead Board": "Call lead-hot and claim-card, then show this week's actionable leads from those returned records. Do not open or rebuild a lead-board file.",
    "Open the Deal Room": "Call deal-room-board and show signed, on-deck, and hot deal records from its response. Do not refresh or open a Deal Room file.",
