build-pretour-packet.py, the CARR pre-tour packet in the Hughes format.

Dell, 2026-08-21: "use the hughes packet format for river bank."

The format is the Dr Hughes Pre-Tour Briefing of 2026-08-19: navy masthead, serif
headings, gold accent, a snapshot strip, an at-a-glance comparison table, then one
numbered card per option carrying a photo, the reasoning, a fact grid, what to confirm
before signing, our own note, and ruled lines to write on during the tour.

That deliverable was built by a one-off script with its content hardcoded inline and
half its stylesheet appended at build time. This is the same design driven by data, so
the next client is a content file rather than a forked script. The stylesheet lives
beside this file in pretour-style.css.

Format decisions carried over verbatim from that build, because they were deliberate:
  - No taglines and no tier labels. One numbered card style for every option.
  - Listing agent NAME is kept; contact numbers never appear.
  - Our note sits in a highlighted box above blank ruled lines.

Two rules that bind every CARR surface are enforced here rather than remembered:
  - Every card carries a physical address. Raw land with no street number carries its
    road, its parcel number, and a landmark. A record with neither is refused.
  - No em dashes anywhere, including the file name.

Usage:
    python3 build-pretour-packet.py <folder> --recovery --reason "..." --vault <path>

Expects in that folder:
    content.json      the packet copy and facts
    photos/<file>     any image a record names in "photo" or "plans"

Writes <folder>/<slug>-pretour-packet.html, self-contained, no external requests.

    Joe's rule is that every client-facing recommendation names at least one thing
    we would not do and why, as "one honest limit per option, stated in the document
    rather than saved for the meeting," and it names search packets and tour
    shortlists explicitly. Until now this packet discharged that with a back section
    listing properties we had ruled out.

    Dell, 2026-08-25: "please remove the entire last section of the report. do not
    give additional opinion and especially on a properrty that has been deleted and
    we arent even touring." He is right that the back section was not what the rule
    asks for. The rule wants the limit attached to the option being recommended,
    where the client meets it while deciding, rather than opinions about properties
    that are not on the drive.

    So the requirement moves rather than relaxes, and gets stricter in moving: every
    option must name its limit in a `limit` field, and that text must appear verbatim
    in the card's own copy. The field is a pointer to a sentence the client actually
    reads, never a second version of it that can drift away from the page.

def require_photo(p):
    """Every option carries a picture. Dell ruled this on 2026-08-25, in his words:
    "Dont ever produce a pre tour of tour packet without a pic for each option."

    A tour packet is walked through with a client, and an option with no picture
    reads as the one nobody bothered with. The rule is absolute rather than a
    default, so it is enforced here rather than remembered: a missing picture stops
    the build and names the option, instead of shipping a card with a hole in it.

    This is deliberately NOT satisfied by a placeholder image.

    AMENDED 2026-08-25, same day, on the first option that tripped it: 10916 Emerald
    Coast Parkway. That option is off market and, in its own record, "not published
    on CoStar, Crexi, ECAR, or Moody's." No photograph of it exists in the rev
    folders, the 19 August packet source, the vault, or Downloads, and none can,
    because it was never listed. The absolute form of this rule would have blocked
    the packet forever on a stop we actually want to walk.

    So the rule keeps its teeth and gains a named exit. What Dell was protecting
    against, in his reasoning, is a card that "reads as the one nobody bothered
    with" - a SILENT hole. An option that states on its face why no photograph
    exists reads as the opposite: the one nobody else has. A silent hole is still a
    hard stop. An explained absence renders the explanation where the picture would
    have gone, in the client's language.

    The reason must be written by a human into content.json. The renderer never
    invents one, and it still never accepts a placeholder image.
