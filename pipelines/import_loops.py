"""Import the four markdown accumulators into loop_block + loop_item (ORDER 31(c)).

  00_Context/open-loops.md          -> kind open_loop, block 'hot'
  00_Context/open-loops-backlog.md  -> kind open_loop, blocks 'backlog' + 'backlog-orphan'
  DNA/Team/action-required.md       -> kind action_required, blocks 'open' + 'done'
  DNA/Team/team-loops.md            -> kind team_loop, blocks 'open' + 'done'

WHAT FIDELITY MEANS HERE. These files are not a spreadsheet with a tidy schema.
They are four years of human editing in markdown tables, and the importer's job
is to lift them into records WITHOUT correcting them. Everything below that looks
like over-engineering is one measured defect in the real files:

  * NUMBERS COLLIDE. #111 names two different items inside open-loops.md.
    #103, #95, #88 and #108 each name one item in the hot file and a different
    one in the backlog. T34 names one row in team-loops' Open table and another
    in its Done table. Two Done rows use the glyph `🔓` where a number belongs.
    All of it is imported verbatim and REPORTED; renumbering is a content change
    and content changes are Joe's.

  * THREE ROWS DISAGREE WITH THEIR OWN HEADER. backlog #66 carries 5 cells
    against a 6-column header (the Owner cell is simply absent, so 'Joe' and the
    date sit one position left of where they belong). backlog #76 carries 7.
    action-required A10 sits in the 5-column DONE table carrying the OPEN table's
    6. Each gets a per-row col_order so the render puts every cell back exactly
    where it was. Deciding which cell "really" means Owner would be inventing
    data, and the order's stop rule says review list, never a guess.

  * ONE ROW HAS NO HEADER ABOVE IT. backlog #87 sits under the '## Closed'
    heading as a bare table row with no header line. It is open ❓ content filed
    under a Closed heading. Imported into a HEADERLESS block, which renders rows
    with no header row — so it comes back byte-identical, in place, wrong exactly
    the way Joe left it, and it appears on the review list.

  * ONE CELL CONTAINS A LINE BREAK. team-loops T54's Notes cell spans two
    physical lines. The row parser joins on the newline and stores it; the render
    re-emits it.

  * ONE CELL CONTAINS AN ESCAPED PIPE. T36 quotes an email subject with `\\|`.
    The cell splitter respects the escape.

  * MARKERS ARE NOT ALL DATES. `🗓TABLED` is a real value (#86). The literal is
    stored verbatim in marker_literal and re-emitted; due_on is filled only when
    the marker actually is a date. Normalizing '🗓TABLED' into a date column would
    mean either losing the word or inventing a day.

PLACEMENT IS IMPORTED AS FOUND. Six rows in the hot file would not survive the
design's marker-derived promotion rule (#108/#109/#106 carry ✅, #86 reads
🗓TABLED, #93 and #94 are future-dated and hot anyway). The block a row lives in
is where Joe put it; v_loop_promotion_due names what has come due and update-loop
moves it. See the migration header.

IDEMPOTENT by (block_id, render_seq) — position in the source file, because
number is not unique and never will be. A rerun writes 0 new rows.
