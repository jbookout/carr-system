    WHY THE PRODUCER NOW CHECKS ITS OWN WORK (2026-08-22). Until the Drive vault
    was retired, this verification lived in ops/vault-drift-watch.py: the watch
    loaded Backups/portability-mirror/manifest.json and hashed every mirror file
    against it, so a divergent hash, an extra file or a missing one all read as
    drift rather than being trusted wholesale (that was the point of #64 — verify
    the mirror instead of blanket-trusting it).

    That check was keyed to the vault path. When the mirror stopped writing there
    it had nothing left to read, and when the mirror was repointed to OneDrive on
    2026-08-22 the producer came back without its checker. Restoring the check
    HERE rather than in a path-scanning watch makes it independent of where the
    mirror lands, which is the property the last two months kept breaking.

    IT IS NOT SELF-CONGRATULATION. The manifest records hashes computed from the
    bytes this process wrote; this reads the files BACK OFF THE DESTINATION and
    hashes them again. That difference is the whole value at the new location: a
    cloud-synced folder can dehydrate a file to a placeholder, truncate a partial
    upload, or drop one, and every one of those still leaves a path that exists.
    The one moment this mirror matters is when the database cannot be reached to
