"""run_codex_review.py — Automatic Review Council (built 2026-08-06, Codex
lane; GROK LANE ADDED same day as a verified scope extension — see below).

FILENAME NOTE. This file kept its original name (rather than a rename or a
"sibling" file per backend) because the shared logic — request validation,
worktree lifecycle, the review-contract prompt, the curl/record-finding
write path, status sidecars — is identical across reviewers and a second
near-duplicate file would only invite drift. It is now a small, parameterized
multi-backend runner (see BACKENDS below), not Codex-specific despite the
name. bin/review-council-runner.sh and tools/test-review-council.py both
reference this path and were not renamed either.

WHAT THIS IS. The per-request worker invoked by bin/review-council-runner.sh,
one call per request file. It does five things, in order, and every one of
them is written to fail VISIBLY rather than silently (house rule: a blocked
or failed action is filed, never dropped):
  1. load + validate one request file against THE REQUEST CONTRACT below
  2. for kind="code": `git worktree add` ONE detached, read-only checkout of
     evidence.commit_sha under out/review-council/worktrees/<request_id>,
     shared by every reviewer this request names
  3. for EACH reviewer the request names (independently — see "Per-reviewer
     independence" below): probe for that reviewer's CLI; if absent, report
     INSTALL NEEDED for that reviewer and record it as a SKIP rather than
     installing anything
  4. invoke that reviewer's CLI, sandboxed read-only, headless, against the
     SAME fixed, versioned review-contract prompt (render_contract_prompt is
     backend-agnostic on purpose — it names no reviewer), and parse its
     STRUCTURED JSON output
  5. POST the result to the Worker as THAT REVIEWER'S OWN bearer (its own
     REVIEW_TOKENS slug — 'codex-reviewer' or 'grok-reviewer'), calling
     record-finding — the reviewers' ONLY write, exactly as the smoke-probe's
     'probe' profile locks its own write set (mcp-server/src/mcp.js)

SCOPE (frozen at build start, EXTENDED same day — both states below are true
and worth keeping straight, because the record of the extension is part of
what makes this file trustworthy to a future reader):

  ORIGINAL FREEZE: Codex-only automation, subscription-covered via
  ChatGPT-token auth (~/.codex/auth.json). Grok manual — Joe's 2026-08-06
  cost override, decision 65468572.

  VERIFIED EXTENSION (same day, before this build finished): the coordinator
  reported Grok Build CLI 0.2.118 installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/grok, Joe
  completed `grok login` (OAuth device flow), and the subscription-covered
  headless path live-verified (no XAI_API_KEY anywhere in the environment;
  ~/.grok/auth.json holds only an OIDC entitlement token; `grok -p "..."`
  answered correctly). This was NOT taken on faith — before wiring the Grok
  lane in, this file's author independently re-verified, live, from this
  machine:
    - `which grok` / `grok --version` — 0.2.118, confirmed
    - `env | grep -i xai` — empty, confirmed no XAI_API_KEY
    - a real read-only prompt (`grok -p "read seed.txt, print exactly its
      contents"` under `--sandbox read-only`) — completed cleanly, no
      approval prompt, no --always-approve needed (default 'ask' mode
      auto-approves read-only tool calls, confirmed live)
    - THE LOAD-BEARING CHECK: a write attempt inside a REAL git worktree
      (not a /tmp path — every profile including read-only allows writing to
      temp dirs, so a temp-dir test would prove nothing) under
      `--sandbox read-only`, with NO --always-approve. The write was
      KERNEL-BLOCKED: `~/.grok/sandbox-events.jsonl` logged
      `{"event_type":"FsViolation","profile":"read-only","operation":"write",
      "target":".../grok-write-probe.txt"}`, and `git status --porcelain` in
      the worktree came back clean. Seatbelt enforcement on macOS, confirmed
      live, not assumed from documentation alone.
  On that evidence, the Grok lane below is real, not speculative — build_grok_
  command()'s flags are LIVE-VERIFIED, unlike build_codex_command()'s, which
  remains UNTESTED (no Codex binary exists on this machine; see
  find_codex_binary()'s docstring). That asymmetry is real and stated where
  each command is built, not smoothed over.

PER-REVIEWER INDEPENDENCE. A request may name more than one reviewer
(`"reviewers": ["codex", "grok"]`). Each one is invoked, and its outcome is
recorded, entirely independently — one reviewer erroring, timing out, or
being uninstalled NEVER stops another reviewer's run or swallows its finding.
See run_one_reviewer() (the per-reviewer unit, catches its own exceptions and
always returns an outcome dict, never raises past its own call site) and
process_request()'s loop over active_reviewers(req). The git worktree is
shared (built once per request, not per reviewer) since it is read-only and
checking out the same commit twice is pure waste; every reviewer gets a
private CLI process against that same tree.

EXIT CODES (bin/nightly.sh's own convention, reused deliberately so the
runner's step() wrapper needs no new logic) are now a ROLL-UP across every
reviewer processed for the request — see process_request()'s final block:
  0  = OK.   No reviewer failed, and at least one reviewer completed (a
             reviewer that found zero issues is still success). Some
             reviewers may have SKIPped (not installed) without failing the
             request overall.
  1  = FAIL. At least one reviewer errored, timed out, or could not get its
             finding posted. A FAILURE record-finding is attempted for THAT
             reviewer's own bearer wherever a subject can be resolved (see
             write_failure_finding) so the failure is visible in the record,
             not only in this process's exit code — and it never blocks a
             different reviewer's own attempt.
  78 = SKIP (EX_CONFIG, nightly.sh's own code for "not configured"). EVERY
             named reviewer was unavailable (CLI not installed, or the
             request names no reviewer this file recognizes). Nothing is
             installed automatically — see find_codex_binary() /
             find_grok_binary(). The request file is left in place by the
             caller for a later retry, not filed to failed/, because SKIP is
             not a verdict on the request.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE REQUEST CONTRACT (documented HERE ONLY — per the build instruction, this
schema is not restated in bin/review-council-runner.sh or anywhere else; that
script points back to this block by reference).

Request files are file-per-drop JSON, one work order per file, written to
  ~/carr-system/out/review-council/requests/<request_id>.json
The filename convention is `<request_id>.json` — request_id is a UUID, so the
filename is collision-free by construction with no locking or listing race
needed to pick a name. RESULTS ARE THE DURABLE RECORD (the record_flag rows
this file writes via record-finding, ONE PER REVIEWER); REQUESTS ARE WORK
ORDERS — once every named reviewer has been attempted, the request is moved
to requests/done/ or requests/failed/ with a status sidecar (same basename,
.status.json) and is not itself the audit trail of what was found.

Top-level fields:
  request_id          string, REQUIRED. A UUID. Also the filename stem.
  created_at           string, REQUIRED. ISO-8601 timestamp of when the
                       request was dropped.
  requested_by         string, REQUIRED. Human or system identifier of
                       whoever opened the request (e.g. "joe", "council").
  kind                 string, REQUIRED. "code" | "design".
  evidence             object, REQUIRED. What the reviewer looks at:
                         commit_sha   string. REQUIRED when kind="code" —
                                      the exact commit the worktree checks
                                      out. Never a branch name: the whole
                                      point of a detached worktree is that
                                      the code under review cannot move out
                                      from under the review mid-run.
                         files        array of strings, optional. Path hints
                                      inside the checkout worth the
                                      reviewer's attention first; the
                                      reviewer is free to read more.
                         work_order   string, optional. A loop/ORDER
                                      reference or free-text description of
                                      the work being reviewed.
                         record_refs  array of strings, optional. Refs the
                                      finding should attach to (C-127,
                                      L-204, a deal name, ...) — see
                                      pick_subject() for how these choose
                                      the record-finding subject.
  lenses               array of strings, REQUIRED (may be empty, but present).
                       What to review FOR — e.g. "security", "correctness",
                       "idempotency", "matches the acceptance criteria".
  acceptance_criteria  array of strings, REQUIRED (may be empty). The
                       standard the work is being held to; each reviewer
                       reports agreement/disagreement with each one by name.
  reviewers            array of strings, REQUIRED. Recognized values today:
                       "codex", "grok" (case-insensitive; unrecognized names
                       are simply not this file's job and are ignored — see
                       active_reviewers()). A request naming reviewers this
                       file does not recognize, and none it does, is a SKIP.
  contract_version     string, REQUIRED. The REQUEST contract's own version
                       (distinct from CONTRACT_VERSION below, which versions
                       the PROMPT sent to every reviewer — the SAME prompt,
                       byte-for-byte, regardless of which reviewer receives
                       it; render_contract_prompt() names no backend).
                       Carried through to each finding's metadata.
  timeout_minutes      number, REQUIRED. Wall-clock budget for EACH
                       reviewer's CLI call (not a combined budget — Codex
                       timing out does not shorten Grok's own budget).

A request missing a required field, or with kind/reviewers/evidence shaped
wrong, fails schema validation — see validate_request(). Malformed requests
are not guessable-fixed; they fail loud, in the log, in the exit code, and
(where request_id is at least present) in a failed/ sidecar.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

USAGE:
  .venv/bin/python pipelines/run_codex_review.py <path-to-request.json>

Talks to the Worker via curl (subprocess), per repo convention (stdlib-only —
see requirements.txt's header comment; no `requests` package in this repo).
Never prints a bearer token to stdout/stderr/log; each reviewer's token is
read from its own env var (or the shared env file) exactly once and passed
to curl via an -H argument, matching mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh's own handling
of CARR_MCP_PROBE_TOKEN.

# machine (Grok's own docs: "If the sandbox cannot be applied ... Grok logs a
