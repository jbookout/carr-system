review_queue.py — ORDER 16(a), wave2-design §2g. THE ONE unified review queue.

WHAT THIS IS
  Three streams of "something is waiting on a human" used to live in three
  different places: ingest rows nobody had triaged, documents the factory had
  produced, and social posts sitting in Blotato. Three places to remember is
  three places to forget. This pools them into ONE store and ONE rendered page.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, AND THE PROPERTY IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN REMEMBERED
  It is a SURFACE, never a pinger. This script has no send path, no push path,
  no notification path, and no database write path of any kind. Grep it: there
  is no `insert`, no `update`, no smtp, no webhook POST. A queue that can
  interrupt you is not a queue, it is a boss.

  And DRAFTS NEVER AUTO-APPLY. The ingest lane proposes activity rows as FILES
  under out/review-queue/drafts/. Each carries the exact verb call that would
  record it, so applying one is a human saying yes and a verb-capable session
  running it. Nothing here reaches the database.

THE THREE LANES
  ingest     ingest_inbox rows -> proposed activity DRAFTS, with a confidence
             band and the one-tap call that would apply each. Needs SELECT on
             ingest_inbox; see the credential note below.
  documents  what the document factory produced and Joe has not cleared. Read
             from out/documents/ — the files are the fact; the `document` table
             is the record of them, and it is not readable under the only
             credential this Mac holds.
  social     a POINTER into the existing Blotato review flow, not a rebuild.
             The house rule already writes one open-loops row per scheduled
             batch ("No scheduled post fires unreviewed"); this lane surfaces
             those rows beside everything else waiting, and sends Joe to
             Blotato, where the posts actually live.

THE CREDENTIAL NOTE, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
  ~/.config/carr/db.env holds exactly one credential, CARR_DB_EXPORTER_URL, and
  it is views-only by design (amendment 11). `select` on ingest_inbox and on
  document both return InsufficientPrivilege under it — proved, not guessed.
  So the ingest lane reports NOT CONFIGURED, names the exact grant it needs,
  and drafts nothing. That is a lane status on the page, not a failure: the
  other two lanes are real today and the render happens regardless. Same
  posture as the availability matcher's empty-table report.

  The drafting logic itself is exercisable without that grant: --fixture reads
  ingest-shaped rows from a JSON file and runs the whole drafter, subject
  resolution included, against the LIVE v_ref_index the exporter can read. A
  fixture run writes to out/review-queue/fixture/ and never touches the real
  store, so a rehearsal can never be mistaken for today's queue.

LIFECYCLE (every accumulator states one at creation)
  out/review-queue/queue.json and review-queue.html are ONE stable filename
  each, overwritten every run. out/review-queue/drafts/ is keyed deterministically
  by the ingest row id and pruned at the top of every run: a draft whose source
  row is gone is deleted. So the directory is bounded by ingest_inbox rather
  than growing forever, and it is not an accumulator needing a sweep.

Usage:
  ./run.sh review-queue [--fixture FILE] [--json]

EXIT CODES
  0  ran. An empty queue is a report, not a failure, and so is a lane that
     cannot read its source: the page says which, in plain words.
  2  a genuine crash (bad fixture file, unwritable out/).
