date-founders.py — corevent earn-out dating (open-loops #78 item 4 / #79).
See Automation/radar/corevent-earnout-sop.md for the WHY. READ THAT FIRST.

Stage 0 (always): extract the 409 post-sale founders from the lead router and resolve
                  them against the current owner index. Reports the ~1% naive-join gap.
Stage 1-5 (when corevent.zip + cordata.zip are in the scratch): schema-probe, then run
                  the confirmed join and write corevent-earnout-<date>.json.

CONFIRMED SCHEMA (2026-07-16, first real run against the Jul 2026 quarterly files):
  Both files are FIXED-WIDTH text, not CSV.
  corevt.txt (663 wide): doc# [0:12] | filing-seq [12:17] | event code [17:27] |
      description [37:65] | event date MMDDYYYY [85:93] (some rows also carry a filing
      date at [77:85]; some old rows have no date) | free-text tail [93:] that, for the
      "WAS PART OF A MERGER" form, names the OTHER party's real doc#.
  cordata.txt (1441 wide): doc# [0:12] | name [12:204] | principal-addr city ~[304:327] |
      officer block = up to 6 slots of 128 chars from [668], each: title[0:4] type[4]
      (P=person / C=company) last[5:25] first[25:45].

DIRECTION FINDING (the trap the SOP warned about, one level deeper): the semantically
ideal "disappearing entity" code CORAPCMER ("MERGING INTO:") is DEAD after ~2000 — 0
records since 2010. ALL recent mergers are recorded on the SURVIVING entity as CORAPMER
("CORPORATION WAS A MERGER RESULT" / "WAS PART OF A MERGER. QUALIFIED CORPORATION WAS
<doc>"). So per event we collect the record's own doc# AND any real doc# referenced in
the tail, look up officers for BOTH sides in cordata, and match by PERSON NAME against
the 409 founders. An acquirer's officers are not in the 409, so taking both sides adds
coverage without adding false positives — the person-name match is the real filter.

Because merged entities are NOT purged from cordata (verified 2026-07-16: 99.9% of recent
merged doc#s still resolve there with officers), the join is feasible. A name match is
NOT a person match: every row is filtered to a corroborating signal (the merged entity
is a healthcare-type entity, OR it sits in a territory city) and stays confidence L until
a conversation narrows it. Never a fabricated single date — every row is a 2-5yr RANGE.
