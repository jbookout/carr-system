brief_pack.py — ORDER 16(b), wave2-design §2g. The brief generator's four
sections, as CALLABLE UNITS.

WHY UNITS AND NOT A BRIEF
  The daily heartbeat and the Monday brief already exist, already have their own
  voice, their own output format, and their own change logs full of corrections
  Joe made by hand. Rewriting either of them to compute these four things would
  throw all of that away. So this computes the four sections, writes them where
  those tasks can read them, and the tasks each gain ONE call line. Each section
  runs on its own (--section one-thing) so a caller takes only what it needs.

THE FOUR
  one-thing      The single highest-leverage move per partner, WITH its reasoning.
                 Reasoning is not decoration here: a ranked list a person does not
                 believe is a list they ignore.
  prebriefs      Every event on today's calendars, both partners: who, where the
                 deal stands, when they were last touched, and the one thing to
                 come away with. Generated for the whole day each morning, NOT
                 pushed 30 minutes ahead of each meeting. A page you choose to
                 read is calm; a tap on the shoulder before every meeting is not.
  capacity       Open balls per partner, and rebalance PROPOSALS. Proposals only.
                 Nothing in this file moves work from one person to the other.
  monday-agenda  Decisions only. No status recitation: status is what the boards
                 are for, and a partner meeting that recites it spends the hour
                 without deciding anything.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, SAID OUT LOUD RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER
  The only credential on this Mac is the views-only exporter role. Two
  consequences, both stated on the surfaces themselves rather than hidden:
   1. NO DEAL CARRIES A MONETARY VALUE in any view this can read, so "deal value"
      is ranked by PHASE (how close the deal is to a fee), and every line says so.
   2. `v_deal_board.last_touch` reads 2026-07-31 for all 40 deals, which is the
      import stamp and not a touch. Decay is therefore measured on the client and
      lead touches in v_last_touch, which are real dates spanning January to now.
  A number that looks precise and is not is worse than an honest proxy.

  Nothing here writes to the database, sends anything, or pushes anything.

Usage:
  ./run.sh brief-pack [--section all|one-thing|prebriefs|capacity|monday-agenda]
                      [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--quiet]

EXIT CODES
  0  ran, including when a section is honestly empty.
  78 EX_CONFIG — no database credential at all. The chain reads that as SKIP.

    """THE CLAIM CARD ,  the fix for the finding that six lanes accumulated 9,870
    candidates and promoted ZERO, ever.

    The gate is not the defect and does not move: never-pre-qualify (rule
    72e06bdf) says the machine presents and Joe judges, and that stays. THE BATCH
    SIZE is the defect. Nobody claims from a list 9,783 rows long, so nobody ever
    has ,  `promote-pool` has been called 0 times across 609 local sessions.

    So this presents CARD_SIZE rows, ranked, each with its reason and a
    pre-written claim, and it is deliberately the only bounded surface in the
    lane. Everything upstream stays unbounded on purpose: the sweeps keep finding
    everything, and this decides what reaches a human this week.

    RANKING, and why this order. Window proximity first, because a lease event is
    the one thing in this business with a deadline attached that the practice
    owner is not thinking about yet ,  that is the whole CARR opening. Already-past
    windows rank just behind future ones rather than being dropped: three of them
    expired unread while the shortlist sat in a gitignored folder, and a passed
    window is still a live conversation, just a different one. Score breaks ties,
    and a candidate with no window at all sorts last but is never hidden.

    WHY needs_contact IS A SEPARATE BUCKET rather than a filter. A candidate with
    no phone and no email is not a call, it is a research task, and mixing the two
    wastes the slot that mattered. Hiding them would be pre-qualifying, which is
    the rule this whole design exists to honour, so they are shown and counted."""
