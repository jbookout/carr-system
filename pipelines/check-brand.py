check-brand.py — read a finished PDF back and check EVERY page against CARR brand.

Dell's standing instruction, 2026-08-20: check the whole document, all pages, before
anything is delivered. This exists because the first River Bank tour packet was
verified by counting pages and grepping text, both of which passed while nine of the
eleven property sheets rendered a forty-word paragraph inside a numeric spec cell in
orange monospace. Counts and greps cannot see layout. This reads what the PDF actually
draws: every colour, every font, every glyph, page by page.

The rules come from the brand-voice doctrine (Visual Identity):
  navy #002F6C carries the weight, orange #F57F29 is an ACCENT and is explicitly
  never body text or a dominant background; headers Oswald, body Montserrat.

Usage:
    python3 check-brand.py <file.pdf> [--max-accent-run N]

Exit 0 clean, 1 if anything failed. Findings name the page.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, so nobody over-trusts a clean run: Chrome subsets the inlined
webfonts and emits them as unnamed Type3, so this confirms that no UNEXPECTED face
appears — it cannot confirm the embedded outlines really are Oswald and Montserrat.
That holds by construction, since build-space-search.py inlines them from the brand
asset folder. It also does not judge composition: whether a photo is the right photo,
whether a page is well balanced, whether the words are true. Read the pages too.
