graph-health.py — data-quality anomalies as a LIST, not as dots to click.

WHY
  The Obsidian graph is good at making you ASK "why isn't that connected?" and bad
  at answering it. Every diagnosis in the 2026-07-25 session came from the command
  line, not from the graph. This gives the graph its job back (orientation, shape)
  by reporting the anomalies it can only gesture at.

  Reads the same four sources as build-graph-notes.py plus the generated Graph/,
  so it stays honest about what the graph is actually showing.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  1  Isolated nodes .......... records with no edge at all — usually nothing real in them
  2  Placeholder names ....... TBD / unknown / "last name" / parentheticals
  3  Multi-person fields ..... two people crammed into one name cell
  4  Cross-record duplicates . same person as BOTH a lead and a client — the failure
                               that put paying clients on a prospecting drip
  5  Missing source .......... leads with no source, deals with no referral
  6  Name vs email ........... email local part shares no token with the name —
                               catches the "emailing the wrong human" class
  7  Duplicate node titles ... regression guard; must stay 0 or links go ambiguous

Usage:  run.sh graph-health   |   python3 pipelines/graph-health.py [VAULT] [--verbose]
Exit 0 always — this is a report, not a gate.
