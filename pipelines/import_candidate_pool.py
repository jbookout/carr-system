"""Import DNA/Leads/lead-router-2026-07-13.xlsx into candidate_pool (ORDER 25(b)).

WHAT THIS IS. The router is the market map: 9,320 licensed practitioners across
six territory counties, segmented by buying signal, built 2026-07-13. Until now
it has been a file the board displays and `lead-promote.py` shortlists from.
Nothing could act on it as records. This lifts every row into the pool tier that
Joe's Wave 3 ruling created, where the board, the radar lanes and the promote
verb can all reach it.

NEVER-PRE-QUALIFY IS THE CONSTRAINT, NOT A PREFERENCE. Every data row in the
sheet becomes a pool row. A row matching an existing lead or client is marked
`suppressed_dup` and pointed at what it matched — it is still a row, it still
carries its segment and its contact fields, and it still counts. Nothing is
filtered on the way in, ever. The done-test is an exact equality: pool rows for
this source == sheet data rows.

THE DEDUP SEMANTICS ARE REUSED, NOT INVENTED. Two existing gates read this same
router file today and this importer runs both of them:

  1. The registry suppressor (Joe, 2026-07-14; renewal-radar-sop.md; implemented
     in generators/build-renewal-feed.py). Practice match = 2+ shared distinctive
     tokens after a healthcare/geo stopword list, or equal non-trivial token sets.
     Contact match = registry first AND last both present, last name >= 4 chars,
     both appearing in the candidate's text. The GENERIC stoplist below is that
     file's, verbatim.
  2. The promotion dedupe gate (pipelines/lead-promote.py). Exact email match,
     lowercased, against every registry, roster and deal email — "name alone
     misses the spelling drift this vault is full of (Brielmayer/Breilmayer,
     Lindsay/Lindsey, Connor/Conner)".

ONE DELIBERATE SOFTENING, ruled by the Wave 3 design: the radar suppressor DROPS
a do-not-contact match ("never resurface a lead Joe has explicitly stopped
touching"). The pool cannot drop anything, so the drop becomes the
`dup_do_not_contact` flag. The row is kept, marked, and never re-presented.

TWO PRECISION CORRECTIONS, made because the numbers demanded them and REPORTED
rather than buried (both are reversible with --strict-suppression, which runs the
source semantics verbatim):

  (i) The practice-token rule matches on 2+ shared distinctive tokens. Against
      167 CoStar tenants that was precise enough. Against 9,320 router rows on
      2026-07-31 it produced 30 matches and nearly all were wrong: "panama city"
      (a city the stoplist does not cover) tied ten unrelated practices to L-195;
      "dentistry"+"implant" tied five to L-188. Those matches are kept as
      dup_tier 'review' — pointed at, visible, still on the board — instead of
      suppressing rows Joe has never seen. A false suppression is never-pre-qualify
      failing quietly, which is the one failure this order cannot ship.

 (ii) The contact rule reads first = cn[0] and last = cn[-1] of the registry
      name. That is exact for "Doron Bresler" and wrong for the shapes this data
      actually holds: "Lawrence and Lawrence" yields first == last == "lawrence",
      matching all 16 router rows containing that surname; "Lisa Blady (Gameday
      Men's Health)" yields last = "health"; "Sara Randall-MacDonnell, ARNP"
      yields last = "arnp". Three guards, each the original's own intent applied
      at the other end of the string: parentheticals are stripped before parsing,
      trailing credentials are dropped exactly as leading honorifics already are,
      and first == last is not a first/last pair. 19 matches turned on the
      first == last defect alone.

Neither correction loosens anything. Both make the gate stricter about what it
calls a duplicate, and nothing stops being recorded.

SOURCE OF THE COMPARISON SET. The gates above read lead-registry.xlsx and
client-roster.xlsx. This reads `v_export_leads` and `v_export_clients`, which are
the views those two files are GENERATED from — the same columns, one step closer
to the record. Same semantics, no file dependency.

IDEMPOTENT by (source, source_key) — source_key is the router's License number,
measured present and unique on all 9,320 rows. A rerun writes 0 new rows and
reports what it skipped.
