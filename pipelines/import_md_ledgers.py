"""Import the two in-scope markdown ledgers into activity rows (ORDER 39 steps 2-3).

  DNA/Network/hunt-ledger.md            -> activity, kind note, one row per subject touched
  DNA/Network/deals.md (Reciprocity)    -> activity, kind note, on the vendor the entry is about

WHY THIS IS AN IMPORTER AND NOT A VERB CALL. ORDER 39 step 2 requires "date/author
preserved from the ledger's existing stamps". `log-activity` cannot do that: it is
the only insert path into `activity` (mcp-server/src/tools.js) and it hardcodes
`source:'stated'` with `actor_id` = the authenticated caller, and identity.js will
only ever issue `joe` or `dell` to a verb. Writing a 2026-07-13 ledger entry through
it would stamp it 'stated' — the same word the DB uses for "a human said this to me
just now" — and re-attribute it to whoever ran the import. Production already
distinguishes the two: 63 activity rows carry source='import' and one of them
(V-BNK-013) is authored `dell` while a sibling on the same day is authored `joe`.
That is the ORDER 31 / import_wave1 pattern, and this importer follows it.
Ratified by the Fable supervisor seat 2026-08-01 (lane (b)).

WHAT IS IN SCOPE: THREE OF NINE ENTRIES, after Joe's rulings of 2026-08-01.
The two ledgers hold nine entries between them. Six are deliberately not here:

  hunt-ledger H3  "Honest note on hunt #1" — no date stamp, no author stamp, no
                  subject ref. DROPPED TO FREEZE by Joe's ruling: not imported,
                  the text lives on in the freeze zip and nowhere else.
  hunt-ledger H4  "Hunt #2 upgrade" — dated, author unstamped, no subject ref.
                  DROPPED TO FREEZE by the same ruling.
  deals R2-R5     Nilesh Patel / Jon Shaw / Nate @ EOS / Trey @ Lazzarri,
                  "plugged into N deals". NOT IMPORTED, by Joe's STANDING RULING:
                  counts always derive from deal records, never import as notes.
                  deals.md's own two-way-ledger section already said this ("don't
                  hand-maintain counts, derive them on demand"); the ruling makes
                  it binding. Each became a backfill-check loop item instead —
                  find and record the underlying deals, and the count then derives
                  itself. Importing the number would have frozen a stale 2 where
                  the deal records already show Jon Shaw in three.

H2 WAS PARKED AND IS NOW IN, and it is the reason this is an importer at all.
It was held back because its author is "the Monday brief" — the automation that
runs the weekly hunt, not a person. `log-activity` cannot express that: the Worker
issues only `joe` or `dell`. Here `actor_id` is an ordinary column, so a non-human
author is sayable. Joe ruled it imports with actor `system` and the provenance
string preserved on the row, so the entry never claims a human wrote it.

Nothing is lost either way: both source files are frozen at
CARR AI/Archive/snapshots/2026-08-01-{hunt-ledger,deals-reciprocity}-freeze.zip.

WHAT R1 IMPORTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Step 3 says import only the
portion NOT already covered by ORDERS 32/34's edges. The cross-reference was run
row by row against all 31 production edges: V-SUP-051 -> C-155 and V-SUP-051 ->
L-208 both already exist, so the REFERRAL RELATIONSHIP is edge-covered and is not
re-imported here. What no edge carries is the commercial arrangement — the Provide
1% lender referral credit, standing, on every deal he brings. That is what this row
is, and its detail says so, so a reader never mistakes this row for the whole fact.

IDEMPOTENT by record_source (source_system, external_key), the import_wave1 pattern
and the same UNIQUE constraint. A rerun writes 0 rows. The external key is
"<ledger>#<entry>:<subject ref>" — stable, human-legible, and unique per row.

AUTHOR vs IMPORTER. activity.actor_id is the ENTRY'S author (preserved from the
ledger stamp). The import event's actor is `system`, because the import is the
system's act, not Joe's. import_wave1 draws the same line.
