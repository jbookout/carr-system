"""ORDER 36 step 7 — import the 23 hand-maintained dossiers' analysis prose as
dated `kind=analysis` activity rows.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. --apply writes, and refuses to run unless migration 0028 is
present in schema_migrations (the vocabulary and the render views must exist
first). Run it through db-tap so no DSN reaches a shell command:

    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py run pipelines/import_dossier_analysis.py
    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py run pipelines/import_dossier_analysis.py --apply
    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py --branch rehearse-0028 run \
        pipelines/import_dossier_analysis.py --apply --only Renalus.md

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — the stop rules, in code:
  * It never guesses a date or an author. A section whose date or author cannot
    be read off the file's OWN stamps is imported WITH ITS TEXT INTACT (nothing
    is lost) and flagged on the review list, with the reason recorded per row.
  * A row's occurred_at falls back to the file's `Last updated:` stamp, or
    failing that the file's mtime (which IS flagged — mtime is not a claim the
    file makes). Author falls back to the file's `owner:` frontmatter per Joe's
    2026-08-01 ruling, and `source` records WHICH level supplied it —
    import / import_file_stamp / import_unattributed — so the render can say
    "per file stamp, not this section" instead of printing an inherited name as
    though the section had stamped it.
  * It writes one row per H2 section plus one for the pre-H2 header block. It
    does not merge, summarise, rewrite or reflow prose — the body is the
    section's bytes.

CHUNKING, and why H2: every one of the 23 files organises itself by `## `
headings — dated addenda in the deal files (GulfCoastPelvicFloor,
FirstCallDPC-Petersen) and topical sections in the narrative ones
(LifeDentalGroup, Tyrer). H3s stay INSIDE their parent section; splitting on
them would shred a single argument across rows.
