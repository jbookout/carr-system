"""doctrine_inventory.py — the remaining-corpus tracker for the doctrine-store
migration (P5 bounded batches; design §6, decisions 82a2fb62 + import-door).

ONE JOB: answer "which hand-authored vault .md files are not yet in a verified
migration batch," with a suggested content_class per file. This is the ONE home
of that answer — the doctrine health row calls it with --count, the batch
planner calls it bare, and both see identical logic (rule a8c55a47).

WHAT IS EXCLUDED, and why each class leaves the corpus:
  generated renders    — retire with their exporters at cutoff (never migrate);
                         the set is PARSED from record-home-gate (single source)
  machine manifest     — CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md bootstrap stubs + compiled rules,
                         permanent files (or verb-replaced), never store rows
  briefs               — job outputs; delivery is email/heartbeat, they retire
  _to_delete/          — already staged for deletion
  archived trees       — frozen history; migrate only on a named need
  already migrated     — any path inside a VERIFIED doctrine_migration_batch

Usage:
  .venv/bin/python pipelines/doctrine_inventory.py            # the batch plan
  .venv/bin/python pipelines/doctrine_inventory.py --count    # one number
