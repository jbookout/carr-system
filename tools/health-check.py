health-check.py — the rule-28 façade check as code (phase 3 pilot, 2026-07-24).

Protocol rule 28 (DNA/Team/dna-protocol.md): an automation is verified by OUTPUT
freshness, never by its schedule existing. This script checks every watched
pipeline output two ways:
  STALE  — the output is older than its cadence allows
  BEHIND — a derived view is older than one of its inputs (the picture lies)
Read-only. Exit 0 = all fresh; exit 1 = at least one STALE/BEHIND (so the
heartbeat can surface findings). Run: python3 tools/health-check.py  (or run.sh health)
Cadences are calendar days, padded so weekends (off days, both humans) never
false-alarm a weekly pipeline.
