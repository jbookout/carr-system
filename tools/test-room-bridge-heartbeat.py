"""Unit proof for the room bridge's observatory heartbeat — the receipt turn
the Model Room panel derives its desk roster, liveness, cursor lag and cycle
age from (Joe's ruling 0892c539: the panel reads ONLY the wire).

WHAT MUST HOLD, and why each one is worth a test rather than a comment:

  THE THROTTLE IS REAL AND PERSISTED. launchd fires bridge.py far more often
  than five minutes. An unthrottled heartbeat would post a receipt every cycle
  and bury the conversation the panel exists to show, so "at most once per
  five minutes" is a correctness property of the wire, not a preference. And
  the throttle has to survive between invocations — the bridge is a
  poll-and-exit process, so an in-memory timer would never fire twice.

  A NEVER-POSTED BRIDGE POSTS IMMEDIATELY. Including one upgraded from a state
  file written before this key existed: the panel would otherwise show no
  desks at all for the first five minutes after a deploy.

  THE BODY IS MACHINE-READABLE AND COMPLETE. The panel parses it; a desk with
  no room_seat must still appear (that is exactly the panel's "no wire
  registered" dormant case, and omitting it makes an unwired desk look like a
  desk that was never registered).

No socket, no subprocess, no network, no live desk — every collaborator is a
plain parameter, the same acceptance bar tools/test-room-bridge-cycle.py sets.
