"""carr-system migrations runner (record layer, scaffolded 2026-07-30).

Applies migrations/NNNN_*.sql in filename order, normally one transaction per
file, tracked in schema_migrations. A small reviewed group may share one outer
transaction when an authority-surface migration and its registry successor
must become visible atomically. Forward-only by design: a bad migration is
fixed by a NEW migration, never by editing an applied file (applied files'
sha256 is recorded and re-checked, so drift is caught).

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://... python3 tools/migrate.py            # dry run
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://... python3 tools/migrate.py --through 0170_guidance_import_lifecycle.sql
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://... python3 tools/migrate.py --apply    # apply, confirm host
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://... python3 tools/migrate.py --apply --yes --through 0170_guidance_import_lifecycle.sql

CREDENTIAL RULE (stress-test addendum A14): build sessions run against a
NEON BRANCH credential, never the production writer. Risky changes rehearse
on a branch of production data before touching production. This runner
cannot tell a branch URL from production, so it prints the host and makes
you confirm — read what it prints.

# ── MIGRATIONS THAT BIND TO ONE PRODUCTION ROW AND ARE INERT ELSEWHERE ──────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-22, defect 87da6fe5). 0248 registers the conduct-stop
# control and binds it to the autonomy rule, with an insert requiring that rule
# to exist as `proposed` and a proof block that raises when the insert matched
# nothing. That row exists in Production and nowhere else. So 0248 applied
# cleanly to Production and then failed on the isolated staging project, which
# stopped at 206 applied while Production reached 209.
#
# That is not a cosmetic gap. The typed staging readback compares staging's
# schema against a release candidate's exact declared migration set, so it could
# never match; the recovery rehearsal could not complete; and Production approval
# refuses without a rehearsal bundle. Every Production release was blocked, and
# the repository could no longer reconstruct a non-production environment, which
# is Program 1's rebuild clause.
#
# Every obvious repair is closed by design. The file cannot be edited —
# validate_applied_ledger records a sha256 per applied migration and refuses an
# edited one, correctly. It cannot be re-applied to Production either, since the
# rule is now `active` rather than `proposed`. A forward repair migration cannot
# help, because migrations run in filename order and any new number runs after
# it. The rename-alias table covers historical renames only.
#
# SO THE RUNNER LEARNS THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE FACT: this exact file, with this
# exact probe, has nothing to do on a database where the probe finds no row.
#
# THIS IS NOT A SKIP-ON-FAILURE DOOR, and the distinction is the whole design.
# A general "ignore migrations that error" would let any broken migration through.
# Each entry here names ONE file and ONE precondition query that must come back
# empty, checked BEFORE the file runs rather than after it fails — a migration
# that errors for any other reason still stops the run exactly as before. The
# entry also has to say why the file is inert without its row, and that reason
# has to be checkable rather than asserted: for 0248 it is that 0272 registers
# the conduct-stop control everywhere from the repository's own declarations, so
# the only thing 0248 adds beyond it is a binding to a rule that is absent.
#
# Adding an entry here is a deliberate, reviewed act, same as the alias table
# below it. If you are reaching for it to make a red migration green, stop: the
# question to answer first is whether the migration should depend on row data at
# all (rule a8c55a47 — a manual path and an automated path doing the same job
# must be the same code, and an environment nobody can rebuild is not the same
# code).

# the old contract.
#
# THE NEED. Applying every migration to an empty database died at 0014, which
# asserts fourteen client_status rows are flagged and found three: eleven slugs
# entered production out of band and no migration creates them. The fix has to
# run BEFORE 0014 on a fresh database, and 0013 and 0014 are consecutive
# integers, so there is no number between them. Appending at the end would not
# help — on an empty database it would still run after the migration it needs to
# precede. This is the ordinary reason migration tools use timestamps or decimal
# numbering; a single letter is the smallest change that buys the same thing.
#
# WHY IT IS SAFE. The regex only WIDENS what is accepted, so every existing
# filename still matches and nothing about already-applied migrations changes.
# Ordering is unaffected: Python sorts 0013_ < 0013a_ < 0014_ ('_' is 0x5F and
# 'a' is 0x61, then '3' < '4'), which is exactly the order the fix needs. And
# migrate.py is the ONLY parser of the filename shape — v_schema_ledger (0113)
# and mcp-server/src/release.js store and display the string without extracting
# a number from it, so widening here cannot desync a second reader.

# ── DDL TIMEOUTS (added 2026-08-02, cold-session audit) ──────────────────────
# WHY. Migrations are applied by hand against production Neon while a Cloudflare
# Worker holds live connections. An ALTER TABLE needs an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock,
# and Postgres queues lock requests: if the ALTER lands behind a long-running
# read it waits — and every query that arrives after it, including trivial ones
# that would not otherwise conflict, queues behind the ALTER. A change that
# takes two milliseconds of actual work can therefore stall the whole API for as
# long as one unrelated slow read runs. Without lock_timeout the runner waits
# for ever and looks like it is "still applying".
#
# 5 SECONDS, because the failure mode we are avoiding IS the wait. Every DDL in
# migrations/ is a catalog change on a database of ~67 tables and ~17k rows;
# none of them needs five seconds to ACQUIRE a lock, so anything that does is
# blocked rather than busy. Failing fast costs a re-run; waiting costs an
# outage. This is the standard online-migration posture (gitlab, strong_migrations
# and friends all sit in the 50ms–5s band); 5s is the forgiving end of it,
# chosen because a human is watching this run and a spurious abort wastes their
# attention.
#
# statement_timeout is the second half and a much blunter tool: it bounds how
# long a migration may HOLD a lock once it has one. Set too low it kills
# legitimate backfills, so it is deliberately generous at 5 minutes — roughly
# two orders of magnitude more than anything in migrations/ has ever needed on
# this data, while still guaranteeing a runaway statement cannot pin the API
# indefinitely.
#
# BOTH ARE OVERRIDABLE, because the day someone writes a genuine long backfill
# they should raise the ceiling consciously rather than delete this block:
#   CARR_MIGRATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT=30s CARR_MIGRATE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT=30min
# A migration may also override either one for itself with `set local ...` as
# its first statement; SET LOCAL inside the transaction wins over the session
# value set here, and reverts at commit.
