"""flash-script.py — Flash answers a question about data too large to read, by writing and running scripts, with
Jev steering each turn. This is the `flash-script-v3` protocol of the Model Room routing policy
(ops/config/model-routes.v1.json, route "script").

WHERE IT CAME FROM. Revision 3 of the Jev-steered harness, tested 2026-09-24 on nine data tasks with 15 runs each
per version: Flash alone 7 of 9 once; with Jev 8, 9, 10 and then 12 of 15 as each fault was found and fixed. Only the
revision 3 path is kept here; the planning mode (7 of 15) and the one-phrase-per-call labelling (1 of 6) lost.

THE LOOP. Flash sees the question and a preview of the files (sizes, line counts, first lines), never whole files.
Each turn it replies with ONE python block, which runs in a throwaway working folder holding copies of the files,
or with FINAL: <answer>. Up to three scripts. Around it:
  - Jev pre-read: hints for multi-document questions and for labelling by meaning.
  - After each script, Jev reads its output for warning signs (misparsed records, too few matches, a value far
    outside the sample range) and picks the next turn's focus: answer now, compute the full answer, or no steer.
  - Every script-writing turn is capped at COMPUTE_TOKENS. A turn that runs out of room is followed by one with
    thinking OFF and a short-rules instruction (fault 8: thinking spirals, a cap alone only shortens them).
  - A counts answer that sums below a printed record total gets one free fix when Jev agrees every record belongs
    to a category.
  - FINAL: @file followed by code runs that code before reading the file (fault 9).
Code, not Jev, decides the hand-off: ops/jev_model_route.handoff_reason() on the answer and the turn log
(no answer, an answer its scripts never printed, two runaway turns in a row) names why it goes to the route's
`then` desk.

    flash-script.py "<question>" <file-or-folder> [...] [--json]

Exit codes: 0 answered and grounded, 4 hand off (reason printed), 2 usage or environment problem.
Every run appends one row to out/flash-script-runs.jsonl.

  (b) a line starting with FINAL: followed by only the answer, in the format the question asks.

Rules:
- Explore before you compute: print a few lines, distinct formats, counts of odd rows. Data may be messy.
- Print small results, never whole files.
- Check your answer with a second, independent method when you can.
- For judgments code cannot make (meaning of free text), a script may do `from flashlib import llm` and call
  llm(prompt) -> str, which asks a capable language model. Batch many items per call (e.g. 50 numbered lines,
  ask for one label per line) and keep calls under ~100.
- Standard library only.
- If the answer is too long to read back in 2500 characters (a long list), have the script write the exact final
  answer to a file in the working directory, e.g. final_answer.json, and then reply FINAL: @final_answer.json"""
