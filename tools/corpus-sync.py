"""
corpus-sync.py — the doctrine corpus mirror (ORDER 30, Wave 4 phase 1, 2026-07-31;
CORPUS FLIP 2026-08-06 — see below).

WHAT THIS IS. `corpus/` holds a byte-for-byte copy of the vault's DOCTRINE tier
so that rules and craft gain what records already have: version history, diffs,
and a way to answer "when did we decide that, and what did it say before?"

THE FLIP (2026-08-06). Both partners confirmed: the doctrine tier is now
**GIT-CANONICAL**. corpus/ under this repo is the source of truth; the Drive
(and drive:/home:-prefixed) copies are RENDERS, kept current by pushing git's
content out to them. This inverts the original phase-1 design, which ran the
other way (Drive canonical, mirror read-only). That original direction survives
only as `--sync`, now the CONFLICT-RESOLUTION path, not the normal flow.

So the two drift directions now mean opposite things from phase 1:
  * git (corpus/) differs from what was last synced = NORMAL. Doctrine changed
    in git; push it out with `--push`.
  * the source-side (Drive/vault/home) copy differs from what was last synced
    = A CONFLICT. Since git is canonical, a hand-edit on the Drive side is a
    violation — `--push` will not silently overwrite it. It prints a loud
    CONFLICT line naming the file and skips it; a human resolves by folding
    the edit into git (or, for the rare deliberate case, running `--sync` to
    pull it into git first).

Drift is detected by CONTENT HASH against the manifest, never by mtime alone:
Google Drive File Stream rewrites mtimes on its own schedule, so an mtime test
would cry wolf nightly and, worse, could miss a real edit that preserved mtime.

Usage:
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py               # check only; exit 0 clean / 1 to-push / 2 conflict
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py --push        # push git -> source-side (the normal flow, post-flip)
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py --sync        # CONFLICT-RESOLUTION path: pull source-side -> git
                                              # (refuses to clobber a git-side edit; --force discards it)
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py --sync --force  # ...and DISCARD git-side edits, restoring from the Drive
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py --prune       # with --sync: delete mirror files no longer in the set
  python3 tools/corpus-sync.py --json        # machine-readable status

The set of files that ARE the corpus lives in corpus/corpus-set.tsv, one row per
file with the reason it counts as doctrine. Adding doctrine = adding a row.
No network, no credential, no database.
