"""pitr-restore-proof.py — PROVE how recent a point production can be restored
to (V5-F08, the record-layer RPO cell). Run through bin/pitr-restore-proof.sh.

WHY A PROOF AND NOT A READ. The database provider's API reports the project's
history retention, but no field anywhere names a "latest restorable point", and
"point-in-time restore is enabled" is a setting, not a measurement. So this
measures it, with a positive probe AND a negative control:

  1. write a POSITIVE probe row (ops.pitr_probe via ops.write_pitr_probe: the
     nonce and the write instant are made by the server, migration 0597);
  2. wait until the DATABASE clock is >= its write instant + 61 s, and take
     T = that clock floored to whole seconds (the provider's point and the
     probe's write instant share one clock, so the machine's clock is never
     consulted);
  3. wait until the database clock is >= T + 6 s and write a NEGATIVE probe;
  4. pass the neon-disposable-branch metering admission, record the branch name
     to a local state file, then ask the provider API for a branch whose
     parent_id is the production branch and parent_timestamp is T, expiring in
     one hour;
  5. read the branch back: parent_id, parent_timestamp == T exactly, and a
     resolved parent_lsn;
  6. through a READ-ONLY session on the branch: the positive probe must be
     present with the same id, nonce and write instant, the negative probe must
     be ABSENT, and the core tables must hold rows;
  7. delete the branch by id and confirm the provider answers 404 for it.

`verify` then RECOMPUTES what can still be recomputed rather than trusting the
file `prove` wrote: it re-reads both probe rows from production (read-only),
re-reads the default branch id and the history retention from the provider,
and confirms the branch's life from the provider's OPERATIONS LOG — a finished
create_branch and a finished delete_timeline on that branch id, no older than
the proof's start — rather than from a 404, which an invented branch id also
returns. Its output is the evidence block, stamped with the verify re-read
binding (lib/recovery_evidence.py) that mcp-server/bin/recovery-matrix-evaluate.mjs
`rpo -` requires, judged at the real current time.

WHAT IS WRITTEN. Production business data is never written. The only writes
are the two probe rows, through the one function migration 0597 made for them,
on the owner connection; ops.pitr_probe is append-only. Every other production
session is read-only (default_transaction_read_only=on).

NO SECRET LEAVES THIS PROCESS. The provider key is read from the environment
(NEON_API_KEY, loaded by the wrapper) and sent only as an Authorization header.
Connection strings come from the provider API into memory and go straight to
the driver: never printed, never on an argument list, never in a file.

NOTHING OUTLIVES THE PROVIDER'S OWN CLEANUP. Every branch this creates carries
a provider-side expiry one hour out, so a branch leaks for at most an hour
whatever happens to this process. On top of that: the branch name is recorded
before the create call, an interrupted create (any BaseException, Ctrl-C
included) is found by that name and deleted, a delete the provider answers 423
(an operation still running) is retried with backoff, teardown runs with
SIGINT and SIGHUP ignored, and the next run sweeps whatever the state file
still names, by id or by name. (Review G3 removed the old stand-in-parent
rehearsal mode: its parent could not carry an expiry, because the provider
refuses children of an expiring branch.)
