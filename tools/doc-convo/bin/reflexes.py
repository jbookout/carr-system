"""reflexes.py — Doc's instant answers (loop #250, Joe 2026-08-08).

Some turns are not questions about the book: "can you hear me," "thanks,"
"say that again." Sending those through transcription -> brain -> render costs
~30 seconds to say a sentence Doc could say instantly. A reflex answers them
from cached speech with no model call at all.

THE SAFETY PROPERTY, and the reason this is a lookup rather than a classifier:
matching is on the WHOLE normalized utterance, never a substring. "Can you hear
me" is a reflex; "can you hear me on the Hughes renewal" is NOT — it falls
through to the brain, because it is a different whole utterance. A reflex can
therefore never intercept a question about a client, a number, or a deal, which
is the only failure that would matter (dialogue law 10: competence first, and a
wrong answer delivered instantly is still wrong).

Adding a reflex: the trigger must be a complete utterance that CANNOT carry
business content, and the reply must be true regardless of context.
