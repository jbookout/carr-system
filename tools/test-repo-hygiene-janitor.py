"""Hermetic disposable-fixture acceptance tests for repo-hygiene-janitor.py.

EVERY MUTATION IN THIS FILE HAPPENS INSIDE A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY THIS FILE
CREATED. No test touches the canonical checkout, a real remote, a real user
branch, a registered worktree, a real cache, a provider, or a scheduler. The
"remote" is a second bare repository in the same temporary directory; the
pull-request evidence, clock, receipt sink, refetch verifier, and
worktree-removal door are fakes; the R09 entrant reader is the REAL module read
against a fixture registry root, because that interop is the thing worth proving.

THREE KINDS OF TEST, and the last two carry the weight.

  Behaviour tests assert the janitor does the right thing on a fixture.

  Guard-mutation tests then DISABLE the specific guard that produced the answer
  and assert the outcome flips. Without them, a survivor test proves only that a
  fixture named "dirty" survived — a fixture name is not proof.

  Race tests change the world BETWEEN the plan and the apply. These are the ones
  the first version of this suite lacked: it only ever asserted against static
  planned state, so three real deletion races passed review-free. A snapshot is
  not authority; the mutation boundary is.
