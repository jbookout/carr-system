"""repo-hygiene-janitor.py — R07 disabled-by-default hygiene planner and applicator.

WHAT THIS IS. R03 stopped safely at 312 local branches and handed forward 265
branches for which it found NO machine deletion evidence. This module is the
standing janitor that R03's one-shot sweep became: it takes a census, plans
branch, registered-helper-worktree, and cache cleanup against an immutable
snapshot, RE-AUTHENTICATES every bound fact immediately before any mutation, and
writes one queryable receipt per candidate — including for the candidates it
refuses to touch.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, and the distinction is the whole point. The 265-branch tail is
an input for HUMAN ADJUDICATION. It is not a deletion allowlist, and no code path
here can turn it into one: a tail branch without a per-branch adjudication record
bound to its exact current tip is KEEP, and the reason is recorded by name. The
`<= 40` branch target that motivated the program is a target, never authority —
it appears nowhere in the decision procedure, because a count can never outrank
the deletion law.

THE DELETION LAW, inherited verbatim from tools/r03-settlement-sweep-runner.py
(rule a8c55a47 — the manual path and the automated path are the same law):

  ancestry-merged   the branch's CURRENT tip is still an ancestor of a freshly
                    pinned target, plus a verified tip backup -> `git branch -d`
  squash-merged     a MERGED-into-target pull request whose RECORDED HEAD OID
                    equals the current tip exactly, plus a verified tip backup
                    -> `git branch -D`
  everything else   KEEP, with the reason named.

"Verified backup" means all four of: local `git update-ref`, local readback,
`git push --atomic` to the remote, and an exact `git ls-remote` readback. A
backup that cannot be read back is not a backup, and the deletion never starts.

THE SNAPSHOT IS NOT THE AUTHORITY; THE MUTATION BOUNDARY IS. A plan row records
what was true when the census ran. Immediately before each mutation the janitor
rebuilds every bound fact from live state and re-runs the SAME classifier: a
branch tip that moved, a pinned target that moved, a pull-request head that no
longer matches, a worktree that became dirty or locked or freshly entered by an
R09 entrant, or a cache whose bytes changed all refuse. An entrant that arrives
one microsecond after the census keeps its worktree.

ONE MUTEX, HELD ACROSS THE WHOLE DECISION. `plan()` and `apply()` both refuse
unless this process holds the existing repository-maintenance mutex, so a
competing reaper cannot invalidate a snapshot between the census and the
mutation. `session()` is the intended door and releases on every path.

DEFAULT-OFF IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A FLAG DEFAULT. The command plans and reports;
mutation additionally requires `--execute`, a non-empty
CARR_REPO_HYGIENE_EFFECT_PACKET naming a separately reviewed live-effect packet,
AND a repository that is not the canonical checkout. That last guard is why this
source can express an eventual approved apply while granting no live run here.
This module installs no schedule and enables no service.

EVERY EXTERNAL DEPENDENCE IS INJECTED — the git port, the pull-request evidence
provider, the clock, the worktree liveness probe, the cache digest and refetch
verifier, the R09 entrant reader, and the receipt sink. That is what lets the
test suite drive real git and filesystem mutations inside its own disposable
fixtures while every other edge stays a fake, and it is why no test here needs to
reach a real remote, a real provider, or a real schedule.

INTEROPERATION, all read-only against code this module must never edit:
  hooks/worktree-self-plumb.py    the one repository-maintenance mutex, at
                                  out/worktree-reap.lock — exclusive create,
                                  two-hour stale threshold, owner unlinks.
  tools/room-bridge/worktree_runtime_isolation.py
                                  read_lock_posture(root, owner_alive) — an
                                  `active` or `stale_uncertain` entrant
                                  preserves its worktree regardless of TTL.
  bin/worktree.sh --remove <path> the only worktree removal door.
