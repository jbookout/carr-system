"""test-drift-export-ledger.py — the vault-drift tamper verdict, decided against
the export ledger rather than against a once-a-night snapshot.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The tamper pillar of ops/vault-drift-watch.py compared every
registered file to the hash captured at the previous night's --rebaseline, and
called ANY difference "rewritten outside the nightly export". But the nightly
export is not the only legitimate writer of those files, and never was:
  · bin/refresh-rules.sh re-exports the five rule renders hourly, 7am-8pm;
  · any session running `CARR_EXPORT_LIVE=1 ./run.sh export` writes them;
  · every render carries an `Exported: <timestamp>` line, so its bytes change
    on every pass even when not one row of content changed.
refresh-rules.sh had already hit this and patched around it by re-baselining its
own five paths after each hourly run — a fix that works only for the paths that
one job knows to name, and 2026-08-14 produced the general case: 30 registered
files reported as TAMPER, every diff a single timestamp line.

THE ORACLE. exporters/common.py records sha256(written file) in
export_run.file_sha on every LIVE write, and only on live writes (draft runs
store none, since a draft hash describes out/exports/ and poisoned this exact
class of check in 2026-08-08). So the question "did the exporter write these
bytes, or did something else?" has an exact answer already in the database, and
ops/renders-verify.py already trusts it. The baseline remains the fallback for
any target the ledger does not cover.

THE VERDICT UNDER TEST — tamper if and only if the current bytes match NEITHER
the baseline snapshot NOR the last hash the exporter recorded for that target.
A hand-edit matches neither and is still caught, which is the property that
must not be traded away for quiet.
