# GRANDFATHERED 2026-08-06: predates the nightly type-check tripwire and fails it.
# Fix this file's mypy errors and delete these three lines when you next touch it.
"""Prove the partial-render contract for the CLAUDE.md gist block (PASS 1).

Four properties, each one a way the block could quietly corrupt a hand-authored
file if it were not tested:

  1. WITH markers  — everything outside them comes back byte-identical, and the
     marker lines themselves are preserved verbatim.
  2. NO markers    — hard failure, nothing written, and the message carries the
     exact lines to paste.
  3. TWO markers   — hard failure. Two blocks means one starts going stale today.
  4. IDEMPOTENT    — splicing into an already-spliced file replaces the block
     rather than nesting it, which is what makes the hourly re-run safe.

Read-only: works on temp copies, touches no vault file and no database.
Usage:  ./.venv/bin/python tools/test-partial-render.py
