"""The system report card runner — rubric v2 (DRAFT).

Loop #220. This is the code half of the rebuild Joe ordered on 2026-08-06.

WHY A RUNNER EXISTS AT ALL, rather than a prompt that tells a model to go measure
things. Rule a8c55a47: a manual path and an automated path that do the same job
must be the same code. Under v1 they were not — a human read English prose out of
the report card and re-derived numbers by hand, while the fan-out workflow read
the same prose and re-derived them a second, different way. That is how the Aug 6
run produced a working-brain figure wrong by 4x that only a human caught
afterwards. Now both paths execute THIS file against THAT spec, and the numbers
either come from a command or are honestly absent.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
  - It does not grade. Scoring is judgment and stays with the graders (the
    health-audit workflow's fan-out, whose structural no-anchoring is the one
    part of v1 that worked and is kept).
  - It does not write TO THE VAULT OR THE RECORD LAYER. It DOES write two
    scratch files under out/report-card/ (the captured health and check output).
    That distinction is stated precisely because the first version of this
    docstring said flatly "It does not write", which is false and was caught by
    a red-team seat operating under a no-write mandate: it declined to run the
    tool because the assurance could not be trusted. A false assurance in the
    one place an operator checks is the same defect class as a guard that tests
    for non-empty instead of correct (rule a9ecd5b4). Results-to-database lands
    with its own migration once the category set survives the redteam.
  - It does not re-measure what run.sh health and check.sh already measure. It
    runs each ONCE and lets metric rows read their captured output. That single
    change is what retires v1's measure agent.

TWO MODES:
  --validate   Read the spec, check every structural rule, exit non-zero on any
               breach. Runs no commands, needs no database, takes milliseconds.
               THIS IS THE CHECK FOR THE SPEC ITSELF, and it was written before
               the spec was populated (rule 43e2ef76).
  --run        Capture health + check once, execute every metric's source
               command, sample the independent commands, report. Read-only.
