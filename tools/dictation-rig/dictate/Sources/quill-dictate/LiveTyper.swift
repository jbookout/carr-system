// LiveTyper.swift — in-field revision engine for inline live-preview typing,
// plus the "scratch that" voice-command interpreter (both added 2026-08-08,
// replacing the floating PreviewOverlay panel Joe rejected: he wants the
// words IN the field, like typing, not a HUD beside it).
//
// The pipeline feeding this is unchanged from the panel days — the SAME
// resident whisper-server small.en polling from App.swift/PreviewServer.swift
// — only the destination of the text changed: instead of drawing a
// hypothesis in a panel, we synthesize it directly into whatever field is
// focused, revising it in place on every tick.
//
// Revision strategy: never edit mid-word. Each tick diffs the new
// hypothesis against what's already typed, then backs the diff point off to
// the start of the word it lands inside — replacing a whole word reads as a
// clean correction; a partial mid-word edit reads as a glitch. The
// backspace count is grapheme-cluster based (one visible character per
// backspace, matching what a human eye counts as "one character"); the
// retyped remainder is chunked by UTF-16 units — CGEvent's
// keyboardSetUnicodeString operates on UTF-16, not graphemes, so the two
// counts are kept deliberately separate. The chunking technique mirrors
// Inserter.typeOut (16 units/chunk, 4ms pacing) but isn't shared code with
// it: Inserter's version is an instance method tied to its own
// struct/config, and this path has none of its own.
//
// Every synthetic event carries Inserter.syntheticMarker so GestureEngine's
// tap ignores our own output — without it, our own backspaces/keystrokes
// would look like "another key pressed" and would abort the capture
// (GestureEngine.swift's cancelTriggerGesture fires on exactly that).
//
// All methods run on the main thread — callers (App.swift) already funnel
// preview ticks and the final-transcription completion through
// DispatchQueue.main.async for exactly this reason, so nothing here takes
// its own lock or queue.
