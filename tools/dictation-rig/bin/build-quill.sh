# nobody rediscovers it: this Mac's CommandLineTools ships without its own
# libc++ headers (include/c++/v1 missing), so C++ compiles inside SPM
# dependencies (FluidAudio's FastClusterWrapper) die with "'cmath' file not
# found" unless CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH points at the SDK's libc++. Found and fixed
# 2026-08-07 (dictation-rig Phase A build session).

# --- carry our patches onto the vendored upstream --------------------------
#
# vendor/quill is a SUBMODULE of the third-party upstream github.com/digimata/quill
# (MIT), checked out detached. Any edit made directly in that tree is invisible to
# this repo and a `git submodule update` erases it without a word. Our changes
# therefore live as patch files here and get re-applied on every build, so the
# build is reproducible from a clean submodule checkout and nothing depends on
# pushing to a repo we do not own.
#
# Each patch is applied only if it is not already present, so repeated builds and
# a dirty submodule tree are both fine.
