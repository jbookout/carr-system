speaker_split.py — within-track speaker turns for the CARR dictation rig.

Imported by transcribe_session.py; not a script of its own.

The rig's two capture channels already separate "me" (mic) from "them"
(system audio). That breaks down in two places: several people on the far end
of a call all land on the system track as one "Other participant", and an
in-person meeting picked up by one mic has no split at all. This module asks
FluidAudio's offline diarizer (the pyannote segmentation + WeSpeaker + VBx
pipeline, Core ML, on-device) who spoke when WITHIN one track, and relabels
that track's transcript segments from the answer.

Labels are per-recording only. The diarizer's JSON carries a per-segment
voice embedding, so its output file lives in the caller's temp directory and
is deleted the moment it is parsed: nothing that could identify a voice
across recordings is ever kept, which is the rig's no-third-party-voiceprint
rule (README, "No third-party voiceprints — structural").

Every failure path degrades to the channel label the rig used before this
existed: a missing binary, a non-zero exit, a timeout, no speech detected, or
fewer than two speakers all return the base label for every segment and log
why. Pure standard library, like the rest of the rig's Python.
