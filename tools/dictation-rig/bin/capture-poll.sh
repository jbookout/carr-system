#!/bin/bash
# capture-poll.sh — CARR dictation rig, WO-4 capture-bridge poll side.
#
# Run by launchd (com.carr.capture-poll) on a 5-minute StartInterval, and
# safe to run by hand for testing. Each invocation scans the recordings
# root for session directories that are claimed (.capture.json present) but
# not yet ingested (no ingested.json), and asks capture-bridge.py to check
# whether the worker has produced a meeting_record for each one.
#
# capture-bridge.py poll owns the actual gate — ingested.json is written
# only once meeting_record is real (see purge-recordings.sh's marker
# contract, which purges audio/transcripts off that same marker). This
# script is only the sweep; it carries none of that logic itself.
#
# Env:
#   CARR_RECORDINGS_DIR  — override the recordings root (default: ~/Recordings)
#
# Exit code is always 0, matching consent-watch.sh / capture-watch.sh.
#
# Never touches vendor/quill, ~/.config/quill, launchd, or git.
