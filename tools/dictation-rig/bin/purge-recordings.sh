# purge-recordings.sh — the retention law for ~/Recordings.
#
# THE RULING CHAIN, in order, because each amended the last:
#   db7b0231 (Joe, 2026-08-08): recordings are not kept forever — "we want the
#     context of the recording only. thatas way too much storage."
#   d50e30bc (same day): the gate is INGESTION, not elapsed time. A first cut
#     purged on a timer, which would have destroyed the audio of any meeting
#     nobody distilled — the one case where the raw capture is the only copy.
#   2d1b965f (same day, settles both): TRANSCRIPTS PURGE TOO, with a condition
#     in his words — "purge them both but you've got to summarize everything
#     very well. take all the context needed. who said what etc."
#
# So: audio AND transcripts go, once the distilled context that REPLACES them
# is safely in the record layer. Joe was shown the measured split first (1.6MB
# audio vs 60KB transcripts across four sessions — keeping transcripts was
# nearly free) and chose to purge them anyway. The reason is not storage: a
# transcript is a verbatim record of what a client said, and the whole system
# is built so no table, upload or index holds one.
#
# THE GATE — all three must hold, or the session keeps everything, forever:
#   1. ingested.json exists in the session directory, AND
#   2. it names a meeting_record — the attributed narrative that satisfies
#      Joe's "who said what" condition. A marker without one means the
#      summary half was never done, so the transcript is still the only
#      account of the meeting and must not be deleted. This is checked here
#      rather than trusted to the writer: the condition is a precondition of
#      deletion, so it is enforced where the deletion happens.
#   3. GRACE_HOURS elapsed since ingested_at (not since the meeting) — 72h,
#      because weekends are not workdays (rule 236ca227), so a Friday
#      ingestion is still re-runnable Monday morning.
#
# MARKER CONTRACT, for the WO-4 capture bridge (the intended writer):
#   ~/Recordings/<session>/ingested.json
#   {"ingested_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
#    "by": "<actor>",
#    "meeting_record": "<record-layer ref for the attributed narrative>",
#    "records": ["<ref>", ...]}
# Note the confirm-queue candidates are NOT the summary: those carry evidence
# quotes capped at ~15 words precisely so the queue cannot become transcript
# storage by the side door. meeting_record points at the separate narrative.
#
# ALWAYS SURVIVES: announcement.json (consent proof must outlive everything it
# documents), meta.json, ingested.json.
#
# Until the bridge ships, nothing writes markers, so this job purges NOTHING
# and reports the held backlog. That is deliberate and the safe direction: the
# bar rises before the deletion does.
