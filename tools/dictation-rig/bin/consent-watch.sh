# consent-watch.sh — CARR dictation rig, consent-announcement layer.
#
# Run by launchd (com.carr.dictation-consent) with WatchPaths on ~/Recordings,
# and safe to run by hand for testing. Each invocation scans the recordings
# root for session directories that are (a) still recording (no meta.json yet)
# and (b) not yet announced (no announcement.json yet), plays the "now
# recording" clip aloud for each one found, and stamps announcement.json so
# the same session is never announced twice.
#
# Spec: Addendum 5 / dictation-rig-build-plan-2026-08-07.md, Phase A step 2.
# Recording must never run silently.
#
# Env:
#   CARR_RECORDINGS_DIR  — override the recordings root (default: ~/Recordings)
#
# Exit code is always 0 on a normal scan (nothing to announce, or several
# announced) so launchd never treats a quiet run as a failure. Only a hard
# internal error (e.g. the clip asset is missing) exits non-zero.
