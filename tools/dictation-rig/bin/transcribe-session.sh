# transcribe-session.sh — quill's on_stop hook entry point for the CARR
# dictation rig (Phase A, spec: specs/dictation-rig-build-plan-2026-08-07.md).
#
# Quill invokes this as:
#   /bin/sh -c '<cmd> "$0"' <session_dir>
# which, once sh substitutes its own positional parameters, runs this script
# as: transcribe-session.sh <session_dir> — so the session directory arrives
# as our own $1, exactly like any normal shell invocation.
#
# This script does the thinnest possible amount of work itself: resolve where
# it lives (so it works regardless of which checkout/branch quill was pointed
# at — the dictation-rig worktree during build, or the durable main-repo path
# once merged), activate nothing global (no venv, no shell profile —
# transcribe_session.py is pure stdlib Python 3 on purpose, so plain python3
# is always enough), and hand off to transcribe_session.py. It logs a START
# line before the handoff and a FINISH/ERROR line after, so a hang or a crash
# inside the Python step is never silent — even if transcribe_session.py
# itself never gets far enough to write to the log on its own.
#
# Never loads vendor/quill/ source, never touches ~/.config/quill, never
# touches launchd — this script is invoked BY quill, it does not configure it.
#
# WO-4 capture bridge status pings (added 2026-08-08): "transcribing" right
# before the python step, "failed" with a short detail on its non-zero
# exit. A successful weekly-call distillation hands sanitized proposals to the
# bridge's publish command; it reports "distilling" and leaves every proposal
# pending for Joe or Dell. Routed through capture-bridge.py, which is a clean no-op
# (exit 0, one log line) whenever the rig isn't provisioned or the worker
# is unreachable — these calls can never change this script's own exit code.
