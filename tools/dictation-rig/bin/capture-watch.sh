# capture-watch.sh — CARR dictation rig, WO-4 capture-bridge claim side.
#
# Run by launchd (com.carr.capture-watch) with WatchPaths on ~/Recordings,
# same pattern as consent-watch.sh, and safe to run by hand for testing.
# Each invocation scans the recordings root for session directories that
# have not yet been claimed (no .capture.json) and have not already been
# ingested (no ingested.json), waits briefly for the consent announcement
# to land, then hands the actual claim to capture-bridge.py.
#
# CONSENT-BEFORE-CLAIM, structurally: /capture/claim on the worker side
# refuses any request with no consent.announced_at (400). Rather than let
# every early claim attempt bounce off that 400, this script waits up to
# CONSENT_WAIT_STEPS * CONSENT_POLL_INTERVAL (20s) for announcement.json to
# appear — consent-watch.sh writes it within seconds of session start —
# before calling capture-bridge.py claim at all. A session that never gets
# announced (consent-watch down, clip asset missing) is simply never
# claimed on this pass; sitting unclaimed is the safe failure mode, never a
# claim without consent proof.
#
# Backlog guard: session directories older than BACKLOG_AGE_SECONDS are
# skipped outright, so a Mac that was asleep for a week (or a rig that was
# offline) never wakes up and mass-claims a pile of old sessions in one
# WatchPaths firing.
#
# Env:
#   CARR_RECORDINGS_DIR  — override the recordings root (default: ~/Recordings)
#
# Exit code is always 0 on a normal scan (matches consent-watch.sh), so
# launchd never treats "nothing to claim yet" as a failure.
#
# Never touches vendor/quill, ~/.config/quill, launchd, or git.
