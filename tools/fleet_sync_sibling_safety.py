"""Fail-closed fast-forward for ONE fleet-sync sibling checkout.

A LIBRARY ON PURPOSE — no shebang, no ``__main__`` guard. bin/fleet-sync.sh
(already an inventoried SCAC script entrypoint) is the only caller, invoking
``sync_sibling`` through a small inline interpreter snippet rather than
shelling out to this file as its own script. That keeps this module from
becoming a second sealed ingress for exactly the same one job a single
inventoried entrypoint already covers — see ops/jev_change_tolls.py's
``new_ingress_admitted`` toll, whose own remedy is precisely this: keep a
helper with neither a shebang nor a main guard a library, and host dispatch
inside an entrypoint that is already inventoried.

bin/fleet-sync.sh keeps ~/carr-system's own checkout current through
tools/fleet_sync_safety.py's eligibility proof plus its own fetch/ff-only
logic. This module carries the SAME safety contract for the sibling repos
listed in ops/config/fleet-sync-siblings.json (doctorcre-app,
software-factory today) — repos that live as siblings of the carr-system
checkout, at ``${REPO:h}/<name>``.

Every case here is a DELIBERATE refusal, matching bin/fleet-sync.sh's own
design for the canonical checkout:

  - an ABSENT sibling is a clean skip, never a failure. Dell's Mac (and some
    Macs) simply won't have every sibling checked out.
  - a sibling NOT on its default branch is left alone.
  - TRACKED local changes (``git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no``)
    are never discarded; the sibling is skipped and the dirty paths named.
  - a DIVERGED sibling (HEAD not an ancestor of origin/<branch>) is a human
    question, exactly as for the canonical checkout.
  - otherwise: ``git fetch origin <branch>`` then ``git merge --ff-only
    origin/<branch>``. Never merge, rebase, reset, or force anything.

A sibling's own outcome is intentionally cheap to consume: this module
returns one of three statuses ("ok", "skip", "fail") and a one-line message,
so bin/fleet-sync.sh can report each sibling on its own line without letting
any of them affect its own exit code or block the canonical sync/re-render.
