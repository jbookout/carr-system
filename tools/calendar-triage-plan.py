"""Propose a disposition for every untriaged calendar row in the ingest inbox.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The calendar lane parks each event as an ingest row and a human
(or a session) must say what it became. Fifty-two sat untriaged because the event
TITLES carry a first name and nothing else — "Alex | Dell | Joe Coffee", "Josh
dinner?" — and resolving a first name against the book is exactly the contamination
that welded two different Beasleys together once already.

THE KEY NOBODY HAD LOOKED FOR. The published feed strips ATTENDEE properties, which
is why every earlier pass failed. But a Google Calendar invitation embeds the FULL
GUEST LIST, with addresses, inside the event DESCRIPTION text. That is an exact
email, and an email resolves deterministically where a first name cannot.

WHAT IT DECIDES, and it never guesses:
  filed     — an external attendee email matches a contact email in the record
  rejected  — no external attendee at all, or the event is plainly personal
  (left)    — a real external attendee with no record: a research candidate, not a
              disposition. Creating the record is intake work and is not this
              script's job, so it leaves the row alone rather than inventing one.

READ-ONLY. It prints a plan; --apply is the caller's separate decision.
