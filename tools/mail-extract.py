"""Walk Apple Mail and write out/mail-extract.json — the input tools/mail-touch-matcher.py reads.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The calendar pass proves a meeting happened. Mail carries the
contact that never becomes a meeting, which is most follow-up, and it is the
half of vendor-capture coverage the calendar lane cannot see (loop #169).

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose: it does not read message BODIES. Decision
745ab4aa admits derived facts only, so this pass emits envelope metadata —
who, when, which mailbox, subject line — and the matcher decides which handful
of messages are about someone in the record. Substance capture is a second,
narrower pass over that shortlist, never a wholesale copy of the mailbox.

IT WRITES NOTHING TO THE RECORD. The output is a file the matcher reads; the
matcher in turn emits proposals. Both halves are read-only against CARR's store.

THE ONE LINE THAT DECIDES WHETHER IT FINISHES. Never loop over messages in
AppleScript and never use a `whose` filter: both re-resolve the message per
property and a 1,300-message mailbox never returns (the same trap the calendar
backfill burned two wrong theories on, loop #305). Read each property as a
WHOLE LIST in one Apple event -- `sender of messages of m` -- then assemble the
records in Python. Measured on Joe's Sent Items: 1,342 messages, three
properties, 0.4 seconds.
