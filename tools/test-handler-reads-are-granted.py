"""A table a handler reads directly must be granted to somebody.

WHY THIS EXISTS. work-request-card went down in production on 2026-08-27 with
"permission denied for table work_request_triage_receipt". #751 taught the card to
report whether a human or an agent performed each authority act, and its query
reads three receipt tables DIRECTLY. None of the three carried a single grant.

That was harmless for years because every previous reader of those tables went
through a SECURITY DEFINER function, which runs as its owner and never consults
the caller's privileges. The first handler to read such a table itself is the
first to need a grant -- and nothing said so. Postgres checks table privilege when
it PLANS the statement, so the verb failed for every request, receipts or not.

The same shape took standing-context down the same day on public.rule.

WHAT IS CHECKED, and it is deliberately the narrowest form of the question. A
table that is DECLARED in db/schema.sql, NAMED in a FROM or JOIN in a handler, and
carries NO grant to any role at all is broken for every role except its owner.
That is not a judgment about which role should read it; a table with zero grants
cannot be read by the application under any connection. Measured on the tree the
day this was written: 59 tables are referenced by handlers and exactly three had
zero grants -- the three that were down. No false alarms to tune away.

GRANTS COUNT FROM MIGRATIONS TOO, not only from the snapshot. A grant that has
been written but not yet applied and re-snapshotted is still the repository's
answer to "is this granted", and requiring the snapshot first would make the fix
for an outage fail this check until production caught up.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, stated so nobody reads more into a pass. It does not
know which role a handler connects as, so a table granted only to carr_writer and
read on the reader connection still passes here. That is a narrower, harder
question about routing; this one only refuses the case that is broken for
everyone.
