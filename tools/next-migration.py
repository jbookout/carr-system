"""next-migration.py — allocate the next migration number without colliding.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-13). Migration numbers are a single global ordered
namespace, and the method for picking the next one was `ls migrations/ | tail`.
That reads ONE directory: the tree you happen to be standing in. It cannot see a
number a concurrent session has already taken in a file it has not committed yet,
and this machine runs many sessions against one repository with NINETEEN linked
worktrees. Nine migrations landed on 2026-08-13 alone, from several sessions.

The collision is not hypothetical and it is not rare: on 2026-08-12 a session
wrote 0110, a peer took 0110 while it was writing, and it renumbered to 0111. The
same shape recurred the next day. Each one costs a rename plus every reference
that moved with it.

WORKTREES MAKE THIS WORSE, WHICH IS THE POINT WORTH UNDERSTANDING. Isolating each
session in its own tree is the right answer to sweeping another writer's FILES,
and it is already standard here. But it is the wrong shape for a SHARED namespace:
the more isolated the trees, the less any one session can see of what the others
have already claimed. Isolation and allocation pull in opposite directions, so the
allocation has to be done deliberately rather than by looking around.

WHAT THIS READS, and why each source is needed:
  1. origin/main            — every number already merged, including ones this
                              checkout has not fetched into its working tree.
  2. this tree's migrations/ — committed and uncommitted alike.
  3. EVERY OTHER WORKTREE's migrations/ — the source `ls` cannot see and the one
                              that actually causes the collisions. A peer's
                              uncommitted 0112 is a real claim on 0112.

It prints the next free number and, separately, names any number that is claimed
only by an uncommitted file somewhere — because that is a number that will look
free to anyone reading git alone, and is not.

Risk colour GREEN: reads only. Writes nothing, creates nothing, sends nothing.

Usage:
  ./run.sh next-migration            # the next free number, and what is in flight
  ./run.sh next-migration --quiet    # just the number, for scripting
