"""
writing-lint.py — DNA/writing-rules.md as an executable gate (2026-07-25).

The zero-tolerance AI-tell list has been a document Claude was supposed to
remember. This turns the mechanically checkable part of it into a deterministic
check that runs BEFORE a draft reaches Joe. It does not replace the
writing-audit skill's judgment pass; it precedes it, the same way the ban list
precedes the judgment checks inside writing-rules.md itself.

  run.sh lint <file> [--surface email|social|proposal|web]
  pbpaste | run.sh lint - --surface social

Severity:
  HARD    banned item with a per-instance signature. Any hit = do not ship.
  REVIEW  the rule IS a hard ban, but the pattern has legitimate uses in CRE
          prose (land, leverage, landscape, shift). A human decides. These
          never auto-pass.
  RATION  the rationed filler adverbs: legal once, a finding at two or more.

Exit 0 = no HARD findings. Exit 1 = at least one HARD finding.
Read-only; writes nothing. Source of truth stays DNA/writing-rules.md — when
that file gains a rule, add it here in the same edit.
