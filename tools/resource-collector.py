"""tools/resource-collector.py — DoctorCRE V5-UX-C06 local capacity/route collector.

WHAT THIS IS. The one local collector V5-UX-C06 needs: it measures the Mac
Studio's host capacity (CPU cores, memory, disk) and probes the already-running
ds4 Flash Next server (127.0.0.1:8000, launchd label local.ds4-flash-next,
shared with the Model Room flash desk and tools/dictation-rig/bin/post_call.py)
for model-route availability, then writes ONE observation per provider
(local_compute, model_route) through the record-resource-observation MCP verb
(migrations/0580_resource_observation.sql).

NO CREDENTIAL. This script never opens a database connection, never reads a
DB credential file, and never holds an API key. It shells out to
`./run.sh call record-resource-observation '<json>'`, which is the SAME door
tools/call-verb.py documents: the deployed Worker derives identity from a
LOCAL_TOKENS bearer that call-verb.py's underlying local-verb.mjs resolves on
its own -- this script never sees or handles that token. That is what "no
credential" means here: nothing in this file's own code path holds a secret.
This script is NOT the "fallback door" CLAUDE.md's break-glass section
describes (`./run.sh call --reason ... --branch ...` against a denied verb);
it makes an ordinary, always-allowed call to a verb nobody has denied.

MEASURED VS CONFIGURED, NEVER COLLAPSED (C06 checkable_done). Every
local_compute observation carries measured_capacity and configured_capacity as
two independent JSON objects. measured_capacity holds what this run actually
read from the host (psutil / os.cpu_count() / shutil.disk_usage); a field this
run could not read is OMITTED from measured_capacity, never written as 0 --
absence is represented by config-JSON-side documentation and the top-level
`reason`, not by a fabricated zero inside the payload.
configured_capacity holds the operator-declared nominal spec for THIS Mac
Studio (RESOURCE_COLLECTOR_CONFIGURED_CAPACITY below) -- explicitly not the
old Mac mini's numbers (C06 included_scope: "Bind actual configured Mac
Studio host; do not substitute old Mini specifications").

HOST / SERVER OFFLINE. If the ds4 Flash Next server does not answer
GET /v1/models within FLASH_HEALTH_TIMEOUT, model_route's observation is
state='host_offline' with an explicit reason -- never a fabricated "route
available: false" wearing the shape of a real qualification result, and never
silently skipped.

RUN IT:
    tools/resource-collector.py            # collect and write both providers
    tools/resource-collector.py --dry-run  # print the payloads, write nothing

launchd. ops/launchd/com.carr.resource-collector.plist ships in this repo but
is NOT installed or loaded by this change -- see that file's own header.
launchd's PATH does not include Homebrew's python3, and the CPython on this
Mac that has no scripting-bridge quirks under launchd's sandboxed environment
is Xcode's command-line-tools python3, so the shebang above is intentional;
do not "fix" it to /usr/bin/python3 or /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.
