db-tap.py — run a production tap (a .sql file or a pipelines/ script) without
shell command substitution.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-31, Fable seat session 3): Joe opened the psql gate
(three allow rules in the vault project's .claude/settings.json), but the
harness classifier still refuses any Bash command containing $(...) because it
cannot vouch for the nested command. backup-dump.sh already solved this shape:
derive the owner DSN from neonctl INSIDE the process. This tool is that pattern
for taps: it obtains the connection string itself, then either runs psql -f on
a SQL file or execs a pipelines/ script with DATABASE_URL set.

Usage:
  .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py sql pipelines/r2-quota-seed.sql
  .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py run pipelines/backfill_document_attachments.py [--apply ...]
  .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py --branch rehearse-0026 run tools/migrate.py --apply --yes

--project staging (before the mode) targets the ISOLATED STAGING PROJECT, a
separate Neon project that shares no data or credentials with production. That
separation is the point: a Neon BRANCH lives inside production's project and
starts as a copy of its data, so it is not isolation.

--branch <name> (before the mode) targets a Neon branch instead of production —
the rehearse-on-branch pattern through the same no-substitution path (added
2026-07-31, Fable seat session 4, for the 0026 rehearsal).

READ-ONLY BY DEFAULT (Phase 1, 2026-08-13): every ordinary invocation, sql or
run, opens its subprocess with default_transaction_read_only=on. A write
against production fails at the server unless you deliberately break glass:

  CARR_BREAK_GLASS=1 .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py --reason "why" sql pipelines/x.sql

Both CARR_BREAK_GLASS=1 and a non-empty --reason are required together. A
break-glass run is banner-announced, requires a local actor identity
(~/.config/carr/local-actor.json, see bin/set-local-actor.sh), and appends a
receipt to out/break-glass-receipts.log before the target ever runs.

Never prints the DSN. ON_ERROR_STOP is always set for sql mode.

    is broken and a channel with genuinely nothing to say produce byte-identical
    output. Its watermark had not moved since the day the login lapsed. Nothing
    alarmed, because nothing watches it.

    A Neon API key does not expire on a timer and needs no browser, and neonctl
    reads it from NEON_API_KEY. This keeps the property the pattern was built for
