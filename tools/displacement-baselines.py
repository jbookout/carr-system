"""Phase 0 displacement baselines 1, 2, 3 and 5, measured from local session records.

Doctrine (carr-workspace-bduf s01a) requires these be INSTRUMENTED OR INTERVIEWED
and never invented, and that each carries its evidence method, observation window,
result, bound product action and post-launch comparison. Measure 4 was captured
separately by timed tasks because it measures human comprehension time. These four
are mechanical and need nothing from the partner.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM
---------------------------------
Everything here is counted, not judged. Where a measure's doctrine wording needs a
judgment call the script reports the mechanical substrate and says so plainly
rather than guessing a number. Doctrine objective 8 explicitly permits heavy
sessions for exploring, investigating genuinely complex problems, and constructing
something new, so total session time is NOT the baseline — only routine-operation
time is, and separating those two is the judgment this script deliberately leaves
open rather than faking.

ACTIVE TIME, NOT WALL CLOCK
---------------------------
A session's first-to-last timestamp span is worthless: a window left open
overnight would read as sixteen hours. Active time is the sum of gaps between
consecutive records within one session, with any gap longer than IDLE_CAP treated
as the partner having walked away and contributing nothing. This undercounts
thinking time spent staring at a screen and overcounts nothing, so it is the
conservative direction.

# "Stop hook feedback:\nCONDUCT GATE — ...". The header was stripped and the ENTIRE
# GATE BODY survived as the tail, cleared MIN_TYPED, and was counted as the partner
# typing. Other machine texts — harness retry notices, interruption markers, skill
# preambles, image descriptors — matched no pattern at all and were counted whole.
# Measured contamination at the time of the fix: 194 of 207 counted partner turns,
# 94%, were machine-authored. This inflated baselines 1, 2 and 5. Baseline 3 counts
# tool invocations and baseline 4 is human-timed, so neither was affected.
