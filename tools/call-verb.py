call-verb.py — fire ONE record verb from a terminal on this Mac.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-08, monthly resurface session). Joe tried to close four
idea rows from the shell and there was no path: `run.sh` has no verb subcommand,
so a session can call a verb through the MCP connector but a human at a prompt
cannot. The capability already existed — mcp-server/local-verb.mjs — but it was
invisible from run.sh.

Usage:
  ./run.sh call <verb> '<json args>'
      Default path: local-verb.mjs runs the verb as an HTTPS call against the
      DEPLOYED WORKER (production, always — there is no other database behind
      it). This is what every ordinary call should use.

  ./run.sh call --reason "why" <verb> '<json args>'
      BREAK-GLASS (Phase 1, 2026-08-13, decision 97e76a2f): requires
      CARR_BREAK_GLASS=1 in the environment too (both together, same envelope
      as tools/db-tap.py — see its header). Derives a direct DATABASE_URL via
      db-tap and runs local-verb.mjs's direct-database code path instead of
      the HTTPS default. Prints the same banner db-tap.py prints and appends a
      receipt to out/break-glass-receipts.log BEFORE the verb ever runs — one
      shared audit trail for every break-glass act in this repo.

  ./run.sh call --branch rehearse-0031 --reason "why" add-loop '{"kind":"idea", ...}'
      Break-glass against a Neon branch instead of production — for proving a
      verb change before it ships. --branch is ONLY meaningful under
      break-glass: the deployed Worker has no notion of a branch, it always
      talks to production, so --branch without --reason (and CARR_BREAK_GLASS=1)
      is refused rather than silently ignored.

  ./run.sh call list-verbs '{}'

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Until this change, EVERY call through this path opened
a direct connection to the production database and ran the verb's handler
locally — bypassing the deployed Worker's identity derivation, its profile
gate, and its read-call instrumentation (tool_read_call) entirely. The DEFAULT
path is now the deployed Worker, exactly like every other MCP caller; the
direct-database path survives only as explicit, receipted break-glass. See
mcp-server/local-verb.mjs's own header for the full design, and
mcp-server/src/index.js's "local token" comment for the server side.

IDENTITY. There is no actor-slug argument. On the default path, identity is
server-derived from a LOCAL_TOKENS bearer (see mcp-server/src/identity.js);
this script never sees or handles that token, it just runs local-verb.mjs with
no DATABASE_URL set. On the break-glass path, identity comes from
~/.config/carr/local-actor.json (bin/set-local-actor.sh) — see
mcp-server/local-verb.mjs for the resolution and its stated limits.

Never prints the DSN or any token value.
