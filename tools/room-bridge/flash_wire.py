"""The flash-local desk: a Model Room desk that answers on the local Flash model itself.

Until 2026-09-24 the queue could reach Claude and Codex desks and Joe, but nothing ran work on Flash: the desk
registered as "flash" was a Claude session with that name. Joe's routing rulings (decisions 81f6bcf7, 79110363) send
direct questions to Flash first, so Flash needs a desk the queue can hand a task to.

This desk runs Flash's direct protocol from ops/config/model-routes.v1.json: one reply, thinking off, a bounded
answer length. It is synchronous like a codex-session desk and returns the same outcome shape, so bridge.deliver and
the queue executor treat it the same way. Script work comes here too (2026-09-26): a task that names its data with
`data: <path>` lines runs tools/flash-script.py, Flash's sandboxed script protocol, instead of one direct reply. Only
data under the policy's `script_data_roots` is accepted, and nothing inside it may be a symbolic link, because the
harness copies what it is given and the answer is posted to the room: a path that could reach a key or a credential
never gets that far.

So does code work (2026-09-26): a task whose body names `project: <path>` and one `test: <command>` runs
tools/flash-run.py, Flash's coding protocol. The project must be the top of a git work tree strictly inside the
policy's `code_project_roots` and not a link. The test line is chat text, so it never reaches a shell as written:
test_argv accepts only pytest, `python3 <script inside the project>.py` or `node --test`, with plain tokens and
paths that stay inside the project. flash-run never touches the project's own tree: it works in a throwaway git
worktree on a new flash/queue-* branch, with --escalate suggest so the desk never dispatches another desk. The desk
re-runs the test on the patch itself, and only then commits on that branch and reports it (success); anything else
drops the worktree and the branch (blocked). Nothing is merged or pushed; the whole run is bounded by CODE_TIMEOUT_S.

A reply with no answer comes back as status "failed" with detail "no_answer", so the task is blocked visibly
rather than completed empty. ops/config/model-routes.v1.json names the route's `then` desk (Opus, via
claude-desktop) as where a hand-off would go next, but the queue path (queue_dispatch.py) does not dispatch
there today: a Hermes queue task's CARR_QUEUE_META.target is fixed in the task body at creation and checked
against the claiming desk's own alias, so moving a task to a different desk needs a new, linked task rather
than a reassignment of this one. Until that lands, a no-answer or malformed-protocol reply here only retries
on the SAME flash-local desk, under its own diagnosable code, and then blocks.
