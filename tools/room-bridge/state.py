"""state.py — the room bridge's own memory: how far it has read the room, and
what each desk has already seen or is waiting on. Pure logic, no socket, no
subprocess, no network — the acceptance bar carried over from
tools/partner-line/watch.py's poll_once() design (fetch/injector/notifier as
plain parameters), extended here to state itself: every function below takes
a state dict and returns a new fact about it, so bridge.py's run_once() is the
only place that touches a file.

WHY A STATE FILE AND NOT JUST THE ROOM'S OWN CURSOR. read-room already gives a
monotonic seq and a `latest_seq` cursor — that is enough to never re-READ a
turn. It is not enough to know whether a turn has already been DELIVERED to a
given desk: a claude-session desk answers asynchronously (dispatch.py's own
docstring: "the desk answers in its own window, and this file does not carry
that back"), so a turn can be delivered in one poll cycle and its reply not
land until several cycles later. The bridge is invoked periodically by
launchd (a short poll-and-exit cycle, matching every other launchd service in
this repo — see ops/config/services.json), so this state has to survive
between invocations or a restart mid-wait would silently drop the desk's
answer.
