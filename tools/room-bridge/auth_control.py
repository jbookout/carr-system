"""auth_control.py — desk sign-in state, and the one-click reconnect the Model
Room observatory drives (complete spec section 17, Joe's order: he must SEE
which models are signed in, and a button starts the sign-in without being
asked).

TWO HALVES, both deliberately small.

  DETECTION. Each poll cycle asks each desk's own vendor CLI whether it is
  signed in — `claude auth status` for a Claude desk, the Codex CLI's status
  read for a Codex desk — and the answer is stamped onto the desk registry so
  the heartbeat receipt can carry it onto the wire. THREE-VALUED ON PURPOSE:
  True, False, or None for "the probe could not answer". A missing binary, a
  timeout, or output this file does not recognise is NOT evidence that a desk
  is signed out, and reporting it as such would paint the panel red on every
  machine that happens not to have one of the CLIs installed (rule 88e9b5eb —
  "not authorized" and "not possible" are different findings). The panel
  renders None as unknown, never as urgent.

  EXECUTION. The panel's RECONNECT button posts a control turn onto the wire;
  this file decides whether the bridge may act on it, and then acts.

THE ALLOWLIST IS THE WHOLE SECURITY MODEL, so it is stated once, here, and
every clause is checked before anything is launched:

  * action must be exactly "login". Nothing else is executable, and an
    unrecognised action is refused with its name in the receipt rather than
    ignored — a control nobody answers looks identical to a bridge that is
    down.
  * the desk must already be REGISTERED. A control turn can only ever address
    a desk a human registered on this machine; it can never name a new one
    into existence, and it can never name a path or a command.
  * the sponsor must be a human partner, server-derived. The room stamps
    sponsor from the verified credential (partner-room.js's
    personalScopeForActor), so the panel cannot fake it — and the seat must be
    "human" as well, which is the same judgment boundary grammar.py already
    draws: a model seat echoing a control must never be treated as an
    instruction.
  * at most one login launch per desk per LOGIN_THROTTLE_S, persisted in the
    bridge's state file, so a stuck panel or a double click cannot open a
    browser window every thirty seconds.

THE BOUNDARY, ABSOLUTE. This file never reads, stores, relays, logs or types a
credential. It launches the vendor's own sign-in flow, which opens the
browser on this Mac, and the human approves there. There is no code path here
that could carry a secret even if one were handed to it.

AND THE RESTART, which is a measured fact from 2026-08-22 rather than a
precaution: a running desk holds its token in memory, so a desk that was
signed out when its process started stays broken after the human signs in.
The bridge therefore records that a desk is awaiting a login, notices the
probe flip to signed-in on a later cycle, and restarts that desk's process
through the registry's own start contract (dispatch.desk_stop then
dispatch.desk_start) — never by inventing a command line of its own.
