"""One task, one desk, no model in the middle.

Hermes runs this. It reasons about WHICH seat a task belongs in; this file
does not reason at all, which is the point — a router that needs its own model
to route costs the tokens the routing was supposed to save.

    dispatch.py send claude-desk "reconcile the loop board"
    dispatch.py send codex-desk "rename this variable across the package" --family luna --effort low
    dispatch.py send codex-desk "repair the build" --family sol --effort high --fresh --checkout new:repair-build
    dispatch.py send codex-desk "Own PR: #1667\nWrites: tools/room-bridge/*.py\nrepair dispatch" --effort high
    dispatch.py desks
    dispatch.py register claude-desk --socket /tmp/cc-socks/claude-desk.sock
    dispatch.py register codex-desk --family sol --effort high --cwd ~/carr-system
    dispatch.py where            # how to find THIS session's socket

Codex desks preserve their thread context. The registry names a default family,
never a model version. Each send resolves Sol or Luna from the current local
Codex catalog, prints the executor slug and effort, and records them in its row.

EVERY DISPATCH LEAVES A LINE in the results file, NDJSON, one object per
dispatch. That file is how Hermes learns what happened without holding a
connection open — a claude-session answers in its own window on its own time,
so the line records that the turn was DELIVERED, not what the session decided.
A headless Codex run is synchronous, so its line carries the actual result.
