"""registry_ext.py — the room-bridge's additive fields on hermes-desks.json.

desks.py (moved here unmodified from spikes/hermes-dispatch) owns the base
desk shape: kind, socket/model, cwd, thread_id. The room bridge needs two more
facts per desk that dispatch.py never needed and that desks.Registry.register()
deliberately has no parameter for, so this file does not touch desks.py at all
(rule a8c55a47 cuts the other way here: dispatch.py's register() is a complete,
tested contract for ITS job, and bolting room-bridge concerns onto it would mix
two callers' concerns in one signature) —

  room_seat      which partner-room seat this desk speaks for (claude, codex,
                 grok, sol, ...). This is what makes echo suppression and reply
                 attribution possible: a turn whose seat matches a desk's own
                 room_seat is that desk's own echo, never re-delivered to it,
                 and a captured reply is posted back under this seat.
  last_seen      ISO timestamp, stamped by the bridge on every successful poll
                 or delivery cycle that touched this desk (register/refresh/
                 heartbeat also stamp it by hand) — the health signal Program
                 4's convention would otherwise get from launchd cadence alone,
                 which only proves the BRIDGE ran, not that a given DESK is
                 still answering.

Both are stored as plain extra keys on the same desk entry in the same file.
dispatch.py's Registry ignores keys it did not write, so this is additive and
safe for both readers to share the one file (rule a8c55a47 again: one file,
one schema, two sets of readers).
