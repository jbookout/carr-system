"""grammar.py — the assignment bridge's one deterministic decision.

Joe's ruled design test: CODE DECIDES, MODELS ONLY AT JUDGMENT BOUNDARIES. A
room turn either matches this grammar exactly or it does not; nothing here
ever asks a model to interpret intent. Two forms, both one line:

    @<seat> assign <ref> <one-line title>
    @<seat> claim <ref>

LEGACY SCOPE. The canonical queue now enters through ``@queue`` and Hermes;
these old ``@<seat> assign|claim`` commands are retained only so their senders
receive an explicit deprecation receipt. They never create a local JSON
assignment log and cannot infer a safe queue capability or task body.

AUTHORIZATION. Only a turn whose `seat` is "human" may trigger a legacy
assignment deprecation receipt.
A model seat (claude, codex, grok, sol, hermes) can echo or paraphrase a
command in the room, and this bridge must not treat that as instruction —
only a person typing it counts. Model seats enqueue their permitted work
through the separately closed ``@queue`` grammar.

THREE OUTCOMES, so a near-miss is never silently ignored:
  "not_a_command"  — body does not look like an attempt at this grammar at
                      all; do nothing, no receipt (an ordinary chat turn that
                      happens to start with '@' is not spammed).
  "malformed"       — body opens with "@<word> assign|claim" but fails the
                      strict grammar (missing ref, missing title, extra
                      lines, bad ref shape). Rejected, with a receipt saying
                      why — the sender typed a command and deserves to know
                      it did not parse.
  "unauthorized"    — the grammar matched perfectly but the sending seat is
                      not authorized. Rejected, with a receipt naming the
                      seat.
  "ok"              — matched and authorized; apply_assignment() proceeds.
