"""The desk registry: the only way Hermes is allowed to name a session.

A DESK IS A PLACE, NOT A PROCESS. Every ordinary Claude Code session binds
/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock, and Joe's real windows sit in that directory. A pid
names a process that happened to start; it says nothing about what the session
is for, and it changes every time. A dispatcher that can address a pid can
walk into any window he has open, including one mid-way through a client
draft. So a pid socket is refused as a target — twice, at registration and
again at resolve, because the file between them is ordinary JSON a careless
script could edit.

A desk is a session started on purpose:

    claude --messaging-socket-path /tmp/cc-socks/claude-desk.sock

That flag is a statement of intent. A pid is not.

DESK KINDS:
  claude-session   a live labeled Claude Code session, addressed by socket
  claude-desktop   a queue-only Claude background session, handed to Desktop
  codex-session    a standing Codex thread, resumed per task through the CLI
  codex-live       a live Codex app-server, addressed by its unix socket
  flash-local      the local Flash model itself, answering direct questions (flash_wire.py)

BOTH KINDS KEEP THEIR CONTEXT, and that is the whole point. Joe, 2026-08-20:
"codex should be able to do the same thing as you. It has its own context. I
use codex equally as I do Claude code." An earlier draft of this file treated
Codex as a one-shot that started empty every time, which quietly made it the
lesser seat — fine for a mechanical job, useless for anything with a thread
running through it. It is not a lesser seat. A codex-session desk remembers
its thread id and resumes that thread on every later task, so a Codex desk
picks up where it left off exactly as a Claude desk does.

The kinds differ only in HOW a turn reaches them: a Claude desk is a live
process listening on a socket, so a turn is delivered to something already
running. A Codex thread is durable rather than live — it is stored, resumed
per task, and needs no process sitting idle between turns.
