"""cutover-watch.py — the query-and-report half of the launchd cutover watch.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-27). Session-scheduled wakeups only fire while a
Claude conversation is alive and idle. The control plane worked all day
2026-08-27 while nothing reported it; Joe had to ask twice. Rule 1f3a7372: an
unattended run logs its findings to the record before it ends. Rule 847f9995:
no unattended path may depend on an interactive credential. This is the
observer that closes that gap without depending on a live session at all —
bin/cutover-watch.sh (invoked hourly-scale by launchd through
bin/run-scheduled.sh) loads only the narrow jobs-ledger credential and hands
off to this script.

WHAT IT READS, under CARR_DB_JOBS_URL alone (the narrow routine credential —
see bin/routine-credential-env.sh; never db.env, never an authority DSN):
  (a) completed jobs (ops.job.state='succeeded') whose completion receipt
      (ops.job_receipt.kind='completion') has no matching 'accepted' row in
      ops.workflow_acceptance for that workflow key/version/mode;
  (b) jobs currently ops.job.state='dead_lettered';
  (c) the full current ops.workflow_acceptance table (context for the note).

WHAT IT DOES WITH THAT. Builds a SNAPSHOT — the set of (a) and the set of
(b), by identity, not by count — and diffs it against the sentinel this same
script wrote the last time it ran (bin/cutover-watch.sh passes --sentinel;
default out/cutover-watch/last-report.json). A run where the sets agree is
silent: nothing prints past the one NOCHANGE status line, and the sentinel is
still refreshed so the next run's "since last time" stays accurate. A run
where they differ — a receipt newly lacking acceptance, a job newly
dead-lettered, or a previously-pending receipt that cleared — composes ONE
summary and writes it as one loop update to open loop #532, through the SAME
call path every other bin/ script uses to reach a verb: a subprocess call to
run.sh call (see bin/calendar-eventkit-capture.sh and
ops/cutover-readiness.py's call_verb() for the two existing callers this
mirrors), never a second implementation of that path.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never calls accept-workflow, disable-legacy-schedule,
promote-*, or any verb that accepts, promotes, disables or dispatches
anything. The only two verbs it ever calls are read-loop and update-loop,
both scoped to loop #532, and update-loop's own base_version guard means a
concurrent edit to that loop is a version_conflict this script treats as a
real failure — never retried, never silently overwritten (the record
layer's own house rule: version_conflict is a question for a human, not
something an unattended script resolves for itself). Acceptance is a
directed authority act (ops.record_workflow_acceptance requires Joe's own
authority session for a canary 'accepted' status) and stays in an attended
session; this script only reads and reports.

EXIT CODES, read by bin/cutover-watch.sh and passed straight through by
bin/run-scheduled.sh so a failure is durably recorded:
  0  clean — no change, or a change was composed and the loop update landed
  1  a real error — the ledger was unreachable, or a change was found but
     writing it to the record failed. Never improvises a file in that case;
     the caller prints the finding it could not land and stops.
