migrate-prod-support.py — the receipt writer and escalation orchestrator for
bin/migrate-prod.sh's prevention wiring (WR-000048 activation, regenerated
design at out/wr48-activation/design-rehearse/prevention-design.md).

migrate-prod.sh is zsh; the two pieces of this design that need real JSON
handling and a durable fsynced write are done here instead of inline shell,
per that design's own §2 note that a "small python helper is acceptable if
shelling to python3 with an argv payload" (no heredocs, no inline SQL/scripts
in the .sh file — scripts live in files, per repo convention). Everything
that actually reaches the record layer still goes through the ONE sanctioned
Bash door named in CLAUDE.md and the design's §3: `<run_door> call <verb>
'<json>'` — this file only decides WHAT to call and reads back WHAT landed;
it never opens a database connection itself.

Two subcommands, both invoked from migrate-prod.sh's trap functions:

  write-receipt --reason-class C --detail D [--migration M] [--host H] --out-dir DIR
      Writes out/migrate-prod-refusal-receipt.<ts>.json, fsynced, BEFORE
      either record-layer call is attempted (design §2). Prints the path.
      Never raises: a failure to write is printed loud to stderr and this
      exits 1, but no Python traceback ever reaches the operator.

  escalate --receipt-path P --reason-class C --detail D [--migration M] --run-door DOOR
      Design §3's retry-then-escalate route for BOTH record-layer calls
      (open-incident, add-room-turn), each followed by an INDEPENDENT READBACK
      through the corresponding read verb (get-incident, read-room) — never
      trusting a write call's own response, per review finding 9 (design
      §3, "the fix"). Updates the receipt in place with the re-read refs.
      Never raises, and its own exit code carries no meaning migrate-prod.sh
      acts on — the refusal's real exit code is never touched by whether
      escalation itself succeeded (design §6: this is pure notification,
      never a second production write path).
