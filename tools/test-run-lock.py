"""test-run-lock.py — the mutual-exclusion contract for bin/run-lock.sh.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-14 the nightly chain reported 30 tampered vault
files. Nothing had been tampered with. The scheduled 02:05 run and a manual run
overlapped, and the second run's vault-drift check read the files the first run
had just re-exported — every quarantined diff was one line, the export
timestamp. Two chains against one database and one vault also race on the
export ledger, the backup, and the drift baseline itself. The chain had no
mutual exclusion of any kind; `./bin/nightly.sh` twice meant two chains.

Written before the helper it tests, per rule e65efc68.

THE CONTRACT, one test per clause:
  1. One winner. Two processes racing for the same lock: exactly one proceeds.
  2. The loser is quiet and non-fatal. It returns 1 and says who holds the lock,
     rather than dying — a duplicate run is a no-op, not a failed night.
  3. The lock is released when the holder exits, on success and on failure —
     and is NOT released when the holder is killed outright, because no trap can
     run then. The test asserts both halves, so the limit is recorded rather
     than assumed away.
  4. A stale lock is reclaimed. If the recorded pid is gone (hard kill, panic,
     reboot mid-chain) the next run takes the lock instead of blocking forever.
     This is the clause that decides whether the fix is safe to leave unattended,
     and it is what makes clause 3's limit survivable.
  5. Different lock names do not collide.
  6. bin/nightly.sh actually wires all of it. A helper nobody calls is not
     mutual exclusion.
