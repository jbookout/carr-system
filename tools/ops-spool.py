"""ops-spool.py — a local SQLite spool between high-frequency recorders and Neon.

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured 2026-08-18. Five launchd jobs record run rows through
tools/ops-record.py at cadences of 120s to 600s. Each recording opens a
connection to the production Neon database, so the database never sits idle for
the five minutes autosuspend needs, and compute is billed around the clock to
carry heartbeats that say "still fine". The same audit found the sharper cost of
recording synchronously: when the recorder cannot land a row — unreachable
network, missing credential, or the 2026-08-17 schema drift where the deployed
recorder wrote a column production did not have yet — the row is NOT retried
later. It is a line in out/run-scheduled.log and nothing else. 3,485 rows were
lost that way in 36 hours. An observation channel that drops its observations
whenever the far end wobbles is only durable in fair weather.

THE MOVE: record locally, flush in batches. `ops-spool.py run <args>` accepts
exactly the argument list `ops-record.py run` accepts and appends it to a local
SQLite queue — no network, no credential, a few milliseconds. A single scheduled
flusher (`ops-spool.py flush`, com.carr.run-spool-flush, every 30 min) replays
the queue through the REAL tools/ops-record.py, one row at a time, in order.
Rule a8c55a47 is why the flusher replays through ops-record rather than
inserting itself: ops-record's registry lookup, failure-class rules, and expiry
derivation are the single check body, and a second writer would drift from it.

FAILURES DO NOT WAIT. A state of failed/timed_out/cancelled is tried against
ops-record DIRECTLY first, because the registry notes for partner-ping and
capture-poll lean on "every FAILURE is still recorded immediately", and `assess`
turns the latest failed run into incident state — an incident delayed 30 minutes
is 30 minutes nobody is looking. Only when that direct write itself fails does
the failure row fall back to the queue, which is strictly better than today,
where it fell on the floor. Succeeded and skipped rows always queue: a
heartbeat's whole message is "nothing happened", and it can afford to be up to
one flush interval old — the registered cadence graces were widened to say so
(ops/config/services.json, 2026-08-18).

WHAT "RECORDED" MEANS NOW, for every caller reading an exit code: 0 means the
row is DURABLE — either landed in ops.run directly or queued in the spool with a
scheduled path to ops.run. Nonzero means it is not durable anywhere and the
caller's log line is the only trace, which is exactly what nonzero meant before.
bin/run-scheduled.sh's stamp-only-on-recorder-success throttle rule therefore
carries over unchanged: a stamp means the row will reach the ledger, not that it
already has.

WHAT THE SPOOL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never edits, reorders, merges,
throttles or interprets rows. Whatever argv arrives is what ops-record replays.
Timeliness decisions (the wrapper's --heartbeat-interval) and correctness
decisions (ops-record's own refusals) stay where they already live.

POISON ROWS CANNOT WEDGE THE QUEUE. ops-record's exit codes are the sort key:
  0        landed — delete from the queue.
  2, 64    deterministic refusal (bad args, constraint shape) — will never land
           however often it is retried; moved to the dead table, kept readable.
  78       configuration state (unregistered service, absent schema). Retried,
           because sync-registry or a migration resolves it — but rows for that
           service are skipped for the rest of the pass so one unregistered
           selftest probe cannot starve real services, and after MAX_ATTEMPTS
           the row goes to the dead table instead of retrying forever.
  other    transient (unreachable database, absent credential — ops-record
           returns 1 for both, measured). The pass ABORTS and everything left
           retries next flush, preserving per-service ordering: landing row k+1
           before row k would make "latest run" flap backwards at the next
           successful flush.

THE SPOOL FILE lives at out/run-spool.sqlite3 (override: CARR_RUN_SPOOL_DB —
out/ is shared with every worktree, so a test that does not override it writes
production state; the same lesson CARR_RUN_SCHEDULED_STATE_DIR already
encodes). WAL mode so five launchd jobs enqueueing at once never block each
other; a flock alongside the file so two overlapping flushes cannot replay the
same row twice.
