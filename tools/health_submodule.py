"""
health_submodule.py — decide whether a vendored submodule's dirt is the tracked
patches doing their job, or a real uncommitted edit.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT THREE LINES INSIDE health-check.py: it needs a
selftest (ops/submodule-patch-dirt-selftest.py), health-check.py is a script
with a hyphen in its name, and the case that matters — a hand-edit on top of the
patch still alarming — cannot be proven by reading.

THE RULE. `bin/build-quill.sh` applies tracked patches from a sibling
`patches/` directory onto a vendored third-party checkout at a detached HEAD,
so after any build that submodule is permanently modified. That is expected and
permanent. A hand-edit inside the same submodule is NOT expected and must still
be reported. The two are told apart by comparing the live diff's changed lines
against the union of the patches' changed lines:

    equal      -> expected; the build did it
    anything else -> loose work; keep it on the clock

Deliberately NOT an allowlist of paths. Silencing by path would hide the
hand-edit exactly as well as it hides the patch, which turns a noisy-but-honest
row into a quiet dishonest one.
