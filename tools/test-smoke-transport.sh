# test-smoke-transport.sh — call() in mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh must tell a
# network failure apart from a wrong answer.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. call() set RESULT to the empty string whenever curl timed out
# or the connection dropped. Empty matches neither '"error"' nor
# '"isError":true' — the two branches every check in that suite tests first — so
# an empty body fell through to the content greps and printed as
# "expected /<pattern>/ in the result". The nightly chain then reported the whole
# golden workflow suite FAILED under a heading that reads "answer correctness".
# It happened for real on 2026-08-14 (out/nightly.log, chain run 13:03-13:08):
# two checks failed on different reps with blank detail lines, and the same suite
# passed 33/33 in the next two chain runs. The answers were never wrong.
#
# HOW IT TESTS WITHOUT A NETWORK. call() invokes `curl` by name, so a shell
# function named curl shadows the binary. Each case installs a stub with a known
# body and exit status and counts its invocations, which makes the retry itself
# observable rather than inferred from timing.
#
# THE COUNTER IS A FILE, not a variable, and that is not a style choice. call()
# captures the body with RESULT=$(curl ...), which runs the stub in a SUBSHELL:
# a variable the stub increments dies with it and reads 0 in every assertion.
# The stub appends a line per invocation instead, and the parent counts lines.
