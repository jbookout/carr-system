"""Shared loader for long-lived credentials used by UNATTENDED launchers.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe minted a year-long Claude Code login with
`claude setup-token`. It lives as CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in
~/.config/carr/tokens.env (mode 600, plain NAME=value lines), written by
tools/store-token.py (a separate, not-yet-merged PR — this module does not
import or depend on it). When a launchd-driven process starts a headless
`claude -p` session, it normally relies on the signed-in user's keychain
login; if that keychain entry has expired or is not reachable from a
launchd context, the session fails to start. Handing that one process the
long-lived token, in ITS OWN child environment only, avoids that failure
mode without touching how any interactive session authenticates.

THE CONTRACT, held on every read:
  * only the NAMED keys are returned — nothing else in the file leaks out;
  * the file is refused outright if its permission bits are looser than
    600 (any group/other bit set) — a credential file the OS will let other
    local accounts read is not trusted, full stop;
  * a missing file, a missing key, or an unreadable path is silently "not
    configured" (an empty result), never an exception — the whole feature is
    optional, additive fallback, and its absence must look exactly like the
    world before this module existed;
  * NOTHING here ever logs, prints, or otherwise surfaces a value. Only key
    NAMES and boolean/"found or not" facts may appear in logs.
