rotate-credential.py — rotate a CARR credential without any value ever being
displayed, echoed, logged, or placed on a command line.

RENAMED FROM tools/set-jobs-password.py on 2026-08-14 (no callers anywhere; the
old name described one role and the job is now three credentials, and a name
that does not match its behaviour is the thing rule 3578d799 forbids). The
carr_jobs path below is the original tool's logic, kept intact — the interactive
prompt still works exactly as it did.

WHY IT EXISTS IN THIS FORM. On 2026-08-14 a session diagnosing a silent failure
in bin/migrate-prod.sh ran it under `zsh -x`. The trace expanded the line that
sources ~/.config/carr/db.env and printed all three secrets in full: the local
exporter DSN, the nightly jobs DSN, and NEON_API_KEY — the last of which is not
scoped to one database and does not expire. Rotation was the remedy, and doing
it by hand would have meant a password on a command line, which is the same
class of mistake one step further along.

THE THREE THINGS IT ROTATES (AND ONE DISABLED BACKUP PATH)

  --role carr_jobs             ALTER ROLE, then rewrite CARR_DB_JOBS_URL
  --role app_exporter_local    ALTER ROLE, then rewrite CARR_DB_EXPORTER_URL
  --role carr_backup           DISABLED: refuses before local or provider work
                               until a canonical server-validated receipt exists
  --neon-api-key               mint a new Neon API key, then revoke the old one

  --generate makes it non-interactive: a 40-character password from the
  URL-safe alphabet, generated in-process, never shown. Without it the tool
  prompts twice with hidden input, which is the original behaviour. A mint is
  --generate only: a credential no human ever types should not be one a human
  chooses.

  --github-secret is reserved for a future receipt-bound carr_backup path. It
  is never invoked by the disabled public backup route. A future implementation
  must keep its value on stdin, never a command line or shell history.

  carr_backup rotation is intentionally disabled until a server-validated,
  immutable receipt binds Joe's approval and metering admission to this exact
  target and credential material.  A caller-supplied string is not authority.

THE PASSWORD IS SWAPPED INTO THE EXISTING URL, NOT REBUILT FROM THE OWNER URL.
The original tool derived the jobs URL from the owner DSN by substituting the
userinfo, which silently inherits the owner's host and query string. The jobs
entry carries `&channel_binding=require` and the exporter entry does not, so
rebuilding from the owner would have quietly changed connection semantics for
one of them. Only the password is replaced; everything else in the line is left
byte-identical.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS FOR THE API KEY, and it matters: mint, verify the new key
works, write it to db.env, and only then revoke the old one. Revoking first
would take out every unattended path at once — bin/migrate-prod.sh,
bin/import-doctrine.sh, bin/restore-rehearse.sh and the partner ping all derive
their connection through neonctl — with no way back.

  DATABASE_URL=<owner> .venv/bin/python tools/rotate-credential.py --role carr_jobs --generate
  .venv/bin/python tools/rotate-credential.py --neon-api-key

The owner DSN comes from tools/db-tap.py's break-glass run mode, so it is never
typed. Nothing here prints a secret; the only place any value exists afterward
is db.env, mode 600.
