"""scheduler-truth.py — one answer to "what is actually scheduled on this Mac,
and does anything know about it". Program 4's "consolidate scheduler truth".

THE PROBLEM, counted 2026-08-14. Five places claim to know what runs on this
machine and no two of them agreed:

    launchctl list                 16 com.carr.* jobs loaded
    ~/Library/LaunchAgents         16 com.carr.* plists installed
    ops/launchd/                   17 plists in the repo
    ops/config/services.json       23 services declared
    ops.service                    23 rows (25 service/environment rows)

Every one of those numbers was reachable in about a minute, and nobody had put
them side by side, so the gaps were invisible: NINE launchd jobs registered
nowhere, and one plist in the repo that is not installed. A job registered
nowhere is worse off than a job that looks unhealthy — it cannot appear in
`ops-record health` at all, so its failure is not `unknown`, it is
unrepresentable, and to a human reading the table that is indistinguishable
from nothing being wrong.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM, because an earlier draft of it did and was wrong.
The registry IS applied: services.json's 23 declarations and ops.service's 23
rows agree exactly. The first version of this docstring said eleven services had
never been synced, on the strength of a `health` listing that had been truncated
to its last 60 lines by the command that produced it. Reading a summary and not
the artifact is rule fa217e48, and the number that mattered was hiding in the
part scrolled off the top: 21 of the 25 service/environment rows have never been
observed AT ALL, which is a far worse finding than the one the truncated view
suggested.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a second registry. ops/config/services.json remains
the declaration and ops.service remains its render; this file reads all five
sources and reports where they disagree. Adding a sixth source of truth to fix
five that disagree is how the disease spreads.

WHY IT RUNS WITHOUT A DATABASE. A cold Mac, a CI container and a session whose
credential has not loaded all still need the first four sources reconciled — and
the fifth being unreachable is itself a finding worth printing rather than a
reason to refuse. The database section is additive.

EXIT CODES: 0 clean, 1 drift found, 2 could not read the machine at all.
