"""One-time repair: record migrations that are PHYSICALLY applied but missing
from schema_migrations.

WHY THIS EXISTS (found 2026-07-31 by the ORDER 3 session, on production).
`schema_migrations` stopped at 0012. Migrations 0013-0016 were applied to
production outside `tools/migrate.py` — their effects are all present and
verified, but the runner has no record of them, so it treats them as pending.
The next `run.sh migrate --apply` would therefore try to RE-run them; 0014's
`alter table client_status add column note` errors on a column that already
exists, and the run dies before it ever reaches the new migration. The ledger
has to match reality before anything else can be applied.

WHY IT IS NOT A GENERIC "MARK APPLIED" SWITCH. A flag that lets anyone stamp a
migration applied is a foot-gun that skips real migrations silently. This tool
can only ever record THESE FOUR files, and only after querying the database for
each one's own effect. A marker that does not pass leaves the file pending and
says so. When the four rows are in, this tool does nothing at all, forever.

Usage:
    DATABASE_URL=... .venv/bin/python tools/ledger-repair.py            # dry run
    DATABASE_URL=... .venv/bin/python tools/ledger-repair.py --apply
