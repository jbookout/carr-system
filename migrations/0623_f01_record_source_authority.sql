-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F01: authoritative record homes, source authority and
-- document identity. The numbered install of the two reviewed F01 SQL sources.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS. The exact bytes of domain.sql (PR #936 / #939) followed by
-- the exact bytes of ops/document-derivative-registration.candidate.sql, in that
-- order, with ONE line changed: the candidate's psql-only `\set ON_ERROR_STOP`
-- line is replaced by a comment, because tools/migrate.py applies migrations
-- through psycopg and psycopg cannot execute a psql meta-command. Nothing else
-- in either source is edited here. mcp-server/test/record-source-authority-
-- migration.v5.test.mjs re-derives this body from the two sources and fails on
-- any byte of drift, so the reviewed files and the installed file cannot part.
--
-- WHY BOTH, AND IN THIS ORDER. The candidate forward-replaces the four-argument
-- ops.f01_record_document with the six-argument writer that requires a
-- provenance statement, and its own posture readback refuses a database where
-- the old writer survives. Applying domain.sql after it would revert that, so
-- the order is structural, not a preference.
--
-- WHAT IT INSTALLS. Additive ops.f01_* relations and security-definer writers
-- only. It inserts ZERO policy rows: no field owner, no write direction, no
-- retention period, no hold, no Salesforce mapping, no OneDrive item and no
-- object-storage key. Every registry row arrives later through the humanOnly
-- plus authorityOnly register-record-source-authority-policy verb, and the
-- kernel refuses every observation until one is installed. It reads, alters and
-- backfills no legacy row (public.record_source and public.document are not
-- referenced). It makes no provider call and activates no connector.
--
-- THREE ADDITIONS, all after the verbatim sources and none widening anything.
-- Tail 1 restates the carr_reader/carr_writer grants the sources make inside DO
-- loops as static statements, so the canonical role-bundle plan can see them
-- (see that section). Tail 2 is the authority group grant. The two sources
-- grant their authority surface to the LOGIN roles carr_authority_joe and
-- carr_authority_dell, skipping a login that does not exist when the file runs.
-- Production has no carr_authority_dell login today (the control-plane contract
-- marks it optional_nonblocking), and a disposable CI database has neither. A
-- login provisioned later would therefore hold no F01 grant at all, and nothing
-- would say so. The tail grants the same authority surface to the NOLOGIN group
-- carr_authority, which 0273 grants to both logins whenever they exist, so the
-- surface follows the membership instead of the moment of install. It grants no
-- private helper, no guard and no DML, and it reads its own posture back.
-- Tail 3 then takes back the direct grants the sources made to whichever login
-- existed at install, so the group is the only holder. That keeps the sealed
-- SCAC catalog identical in every database: the catalog counts grants to every
-- carr_* role connected by membership, production has carr_authority_joe, and
-- a CI database has no login at all, so a direct login grant would make the
-- measured catalog depend on which logins happen to exist.
--
-- The paired SCAC registry successor is 0624 (v75), applied in the same
-- transaction through tools/migrate.py's atomic group; this file carries no
-- registry change.

-- ===========================================================================
-- Part 1 of 2: domain.sql, verbatim.
-- ===========================================================================
-- DoctorCRE V5-F01 — authoritative record homes, source authority and document
-- identity: the DOMAIN SCHEMA ONLY.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS. The additive `ops` relations and security-definer functions
-- that the F01 handlers write through, plus the structural constraints that make
-- the nine settled decisions properties of the DATABASE rather than promises in
-- a handler. It is domain DDL and nothing else.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT, and the parent must supply separately:
--   * A migration. There is no migration number, no ledger entry, no SCAC
--     registration and no ordinal reservation here. Security attribution owns
--     0499/v25; the F01 successor is v26 and the parent binds it.
--   * Policy. No field owner, write direction, retention period, governing
--     constraint, surviving derivative, hold, Salesforce mapping, OneDrive item
--     or object-storage key is inserted, defaulted or implied. Every registry
--     row arrives through ops.f01_install_policy from a humanOnly plus
--     authorityOnly tool path, and this file ships zero rows of it.
--   * Legacy change. public.record_source and public.document are not read,
--     altered, backfilled, renamed, dual-written or referenced. Nothing here
--     claims a bridge from a legacy row to an F01 identity.
--   * External effect. No provider call, no byte deletion, no notification, no
--     scheduler, no extension install, no role creation.
--
-- THREE STRUCTURAL PROMISES, each enforced rather than documented:
--
--   1. SEPARATION. Current state, append-only events, mutation receipts and
--      reconciliation items are four different relations. ops.f01_apply_observation
--      refuses a shape where one stands in for another.
--   2. RECOMPUTED INTEGRITY. Every stored record carries the exact canonical
--      preimage it hashes to, and the digest column is bound to a CHECK that
--      recomputes it from that preimage inside PostgreSQL. The database never
--      learns a digest from the caller; it agrees with one or refuses.
--   3. NO DIRECT DML. Every F01 relation carries a guard trigger that refuses an
--      INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE that did not arrive through a registered
--      ops.f01_* writer, and every history relation additionally refuses UPDATE,
--      DELETE and TRUNCATE outright.
--
-- REQUIRES PostgreSQL 13 or later: trim_scale() (canonical numbers), the
-- built-in sha256(bytea) (digests) and gen_random_uuid() are all assumed.
--
-- SEARCH PATH. Every function pins `SET search_path = pg_catalog, ops, public`
-- and every object reference below is schema-qualified anyway, so a caller's
-- session search_path can never select a different table or operator.

-- REQUIRES A UTF8 DATABASE. The canonical bytes below are UTF-8 by definition —
-- they have to be, because the Node side hashes UTF-8 — so a database in any
-- other encoding would silently hash different bytes for the same record. That
-- is exactly the drift the readback contract exists to prevent, so it is a hard
-- stop at install time rather than a surprise at comparison time. It is also
-- what lets ops.f01_digest_jsonb be declared IMMUTABLE and used inside CHECK
-- constraints: with the encoding fixed, convert_to is deterministic.

-- 3. The authenticated principal.
--
-- DERIVED FROM THE CONNECTION, NEVER ACCEPTED FROM THE CALLER. The actor comes
-- from session_user — the database principal the connection actually
-- authenticated as — and, for the two authority principals, from the existing
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() helper, resolved dynamically so this schema stays
-- additive and never redefines a function it does not own.
--
-- session_user AND NOT current_user, deliberately. SECURITY DEFINER changes
-- current_user and leaves session_user alone, so the definer writers below
-- cannot launder their own caller into an authority: the principal these
-- functions see is the one that opened the connection, whatever frame asks.
--
-- NO GUC CONFERS AUTHORITY. carr.acting_actor_slug is ATTRIBUTION ONLY. It is
-- read for the ordinary writer principal alone, where it names which sponsored
-- agent is acting behind an already-sponsored connection, and it is checked
-- against the same slug shape as every other actor. Setting it — to 'joe' or to
-- anything else — cannot make a session human, cannot make it a verified
-- partner, and cannot reach either authorityOnly surface.
--
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() IS A DEPENDENCY, NOT A FALLBACK. When it is absent
-- the authority path raises f01_authority_actor_slug_missing rather than
-- degrading to session_user, to current_user or to the schema owner. An
-- unbootstrapped database refuses authority work; it does not quietly hand that
-- authority to whoever installed the schema. Without the guard the same
-- situation surfaces as a bare "function does not exist" from PL/pgSQL's
-- deferred name resolution, which reads like a packaging accident rather than
-- the hard stop it is.
--
-- PARENT WIRING (see the file-foot notes): the four role names below are the
-- principals this schema assumes. The parent must confirm them, and must confirm
-- that ops.authority_actor_slug() exists and returns a slug matching the shape
-- asserted here for each authority role.
--
-- WHERE THAT HELPER COMES FROM, and what it obliges the parent to have done.
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() is defined by the canonical control-plane authority
-- boundary — 0161_control_plane_authority_boundary.sql — as a SECURITY DEFINER,
-- STABLE function that CASEs on session_user, returning 'joe' for
-- carr_authority_joe and 'dell' for carr_authority_dell and raising for anyone
-- else. That migration also revokes it from PUBLIC and grants EXECUTE on it to
-- the NOLOGIN group role carr_authority. This file does not redefine it, regrant
-- it, or wrap it; it depends on it.
--
-- TWO CALLERS REACH IT, UNDER TWO DIFFERENT ROLES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE:
--
--   * ops.f01_context_actor_slug() below is SECURITY DEFINER, so it — and every
--     definer writer that resolves a principal through it — reaches the helper
--     as the SCHEMA OWNER. The owner must therefore own the helper or be a
--     member of carr_authority. The grant loop at the foot of this file cannot
--     supply that and must not try: the helper is not an f01\_% object and does
--     not belong to this capsule.
--   * ops.f01_require_authority_principal() below is CALLER-RIGHTS, so an
--     authority login calling it directly reaches the helper as ITSELF, over the
--     grant carr_authority already holds. That is why the two authority logins
--     must be members of that group role.
--
-- BOTH ANSWER IDENTICALLY, because the helper derives from session_user and
-- SECURITY DEFINER changes only current_user. Adding SECURITY DEFINER to
-- f01_require_authority_principal would change no answer at all; it would only
-- move which role needs the helper grant, and quietly drop the one path that
-- exercises the login's own privilege. The fixture asserts the two derivations
-- agree rather than assuming it.

-- ops.f01_* writer. Combined with REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA ops above — nobody
-- else can define a function under this prefix — the check is structural.

-- 5. The relations.
--
-- EVERY RECORD IS AN ENVELOPE. `envelope` is the exact canonical preimage the
-- record hashes to; `envelope -> 'record'` is the domain record the reviewed
-- pure kernel produced, and `record_digest` is the kernel's own digest for it.
-- Both digests are CHECK-bound to a recomputation inside PostgreSQL, so a
-- readback that agrees with the stored claim has genuinely verified it, and a
-- tampered row cannot be read back as healthy.
--
-- Typed columns exist for keys, ordering and constraints, and each one is
-- CHECK-bound to the same field inside the envelope. An extracted column can
-- therefore never drift from the bytes that were hashed.

-- --- 5.3.1 registered derivative-source links -------------------------------
--
-- WHOSE RULE THIS RELATION SERVES, said once here and referred to below rather
-- than repeated. Q129.D1 settles the per-class RETENTION REGISTRY and nothing
-- about provenance registration. The registration rule this table exists for was
-- approved in native task 01a0869f-fe0d-7493-bda3-ab8b3c0d6683, user turn
-- 01a08779-6b68-7013-bab1-369cf616254f, and carries no canonical decision id
-- because none was issued for it. Where the comments below say "the approved
-- registration rule" they mean that and only that; nothing here is a new settled
-- decision and nothing downstream should record it as one.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS. One trusted producer workflow's record that it created one
-- derived record from one stored artifact: when the system makes a lease
-- abstract, the row says which lease produced it. Nobody types it; the producing
-- workflow writes it in the same transaction that produces the derivative, which
-- is what "before the derivative is considered complete" means in practice.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS NOT, and the CHECK below makes it unsayable. It is not an
-- inventory. The presence of rows tells you what was registered; the ABSENCE of
-- rows tells you nothing at all, because an unregistered derivative — from a
-- workflow written before this rule, from a provider, from a copy somebody made
-- — leaves exactly the same trace as no derivative: none. So every stored link
-- carries registration_is_provenance = true, is_exhaustive_inventory = false,
-- establishes_coverage = false and permits_deletion = false inside the bytes it
-- hashes to, and a row claiming otherwise — or a row SAYING NOTHING EITHER WAY —
-- cannot be inserted at all.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS ALSO NOT: A CHECKED FACT ABOUT THE DERIVATIVE. Nothing in
-- this schema loads, or could load, the record named by derivative_id /
-- derivative_content_digest. The foreign key binds the SOURCE side only, so a
-- registration is a producer's ATTESTATION that it made something, not the
-- database's knowledge that the something exists. Today that is harmless in the
-- one direction it can go — an attested derivative only ever blocks a deletion
-- harder, and no coverage answer can be established at all — but it stops being
-- harmless the moment coverage could be established, because an attested-only
-- link would then flow through ops.f01_stored_derivatives into a deletion
-- receipt as a named survivor that may never have existed. So it is a standing
-- precondition on that work rather than a footnote: DO NOT BUILD AN INGRESS
-- THAT ESTABLISHES COVERAGE UNTIL PRODUCER OUTPUTS ARE INDEPENDENTLY BOUND AND
-- VERIFIED — the derivative resolvable and its bytes checked against
-- derivative_content_digest by something other than the registering caller.
-- Nothing in this file supplies that, and nothing here pretends to.
--
-- ONE DERIVATIVE HAS ONE ORIGINAL. The identity index is on (kind, id) rather
-- than on (source, kind, id): re-registering the same derivative against a
-- different artifact is not a second provenance edge, it is a rewrite of where
-- the derivative came from, and it refuses.

-- put two copies of one predicate in one file, and the copy that drifts is always
-- the one nobody is looking at.
--
-- WHAT IT MAKES IMPOSSIBLE. A stored link that claims to be an inventory, to
-- establish coverage or to permit deletion — and, equally, one that SAYS NOTHING
-- EITHER WAY. The second half is why coalesce is here: `->>` over an ABSENT key
-- yields SQL NULL, NULL = 'false' is NULL, and a CHECK fails only on FALSE, so an
-- earlier form of this refused a record asserting establishes_coverage: true and
-- ADMITTED one that simply omitted the key — leaving a stored link with no
-- self-limiting bytes for a later reader to find. '' is neither 'true' nor
-- 'false', so silence now fails the same conjunct a contrary claim does.
--
-- NOT VALID, AND THE COMMENT SAYS WHAT THAT MEANS RATHER THAN IMPLYING MORE. Rows
-- written before this tightening are NOT re-checked and are NOT retro-verified:
-- the constraint binds every row inserted from here on, and says nothing about
-- what is already stored. A validating form would abort the whole apply on the
-- first pre-existing row that omitted a key — which is precisely the row this
-- exists to make impossible in future, and precisely the row an operator needs
-- the schema to still install so they can go and look at it.

-- ADDED AS AN ALTER rather than inside the CREATE TABLE above, because
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leaves an already-installed table untouched and a

--
-- WHAT IT MAKES IMPOSSIBLE. An evaluation that does not say which coverage
-- answer it was taken against, and — the one that matters — an ALLOW recorded
-- while that answer is anything other than "established". The writer refuses the
-- same shape earlier and with a better message; this is the version that holds
-- even if somebody edits the writer.
--
-- THE TWO IS NOT NULL CONJUNCTS ARE THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CURRENT SHAPE, and
-- they lead deliberately. An earlier form opened with `... IN ('unknown',
-- 'established')` alone: over an ABSENT key `->>` yields SQL NULL, NULL IN (...)
-- is NULL, ops.f01_is_digest_ref is non-strict over `~` and answers NULL too, and
-- for decision = 'allow' the last conjunct becomes `false OR NULL` = NULL. A
-- CHECK fails only on FALSE, so an ALLOW carrying NO coverage fields at all was
-- accepted by the very constraint written to hold when the writer is edited —
-- which is exactly the shape an edited or regressed writer produces. FALSE AND
-- NULL is FALSE, so testing presence first is what makes the rest bind.
--
-- NOT VALID, STATED HONESTLY. Rows written before this tightening are NOT
-- re-checked and are NOT retro-verified; they are unproven, and this constraint
-- makes no claim about them. It binds every evaluation inserted from here on.
-- The alternative — a validating ADD CONSTRAINT — would abort the entire apply
-- on the first pre-existing evaluation that predates the coverage fields, taking
-- the schema down with it to say something about history that nobody needs said.

 * THIS FUNCTION RETURNS 'unknown' FOR EVERY ARTIFACT, ON PURPOSE, AND SAYING SO
 * PLAINLY IS THE POINT OF IT. Registered links prove what WAS registered. To
 * know that they are ALL the derivatives, two further facts would have to be
 * established, and this slice has an ingress for neither:
 *
 *   (a) A CLOSED PRODUCER SET. Which trusted producer workflows may derive from
 *       this artifact's class at all. Without it, "no other links exist" and "no
 *       other producer has run yet" are indistinguishable.
 *   (b) A REGISTERED COMPLETION FROM EVERY ONE OF THEM for this exact artifact,
 *       so that each named producer has positively said it is finished with it
 *       rather than merely having written nothing so far.
 *
 * Neither may be asserted by a caller, and neither is inferable from row counts:
 * an empty ops.f01_derivative_link is exactly what an artifact with no
 * derivatives AND an artifact whose producers never registered anything both
 * look like. So the honest answer is 'unknown', the honest consequence is that
 * ops.f01_stored_derivatives below returns NULL and every deletion evaluation
 * fails closed, and the way to change that answer is to build (a) and (b) — not
 * to flip a flag here.
 *
 *   (c) AND A THIRD, WHICH IS NOT OPTIONAL EITHER. A registered link is its
 *       producer's attestation that a derivative exists; nothing loads the named
 *       derivative or checks its bytes against derivative_content_digest, and the
 *       foreign key binds the source side only. While the state is 'unknown' that
 *       costs nothing — an attested link only ever blocks a deletion harder. The
 *       moment 'established' becomes reachable it stops being free, because the
 *       kinds here flow into ops.f01_stored_derivatives and out into a deletion
 *       receipt as named survivors. So: coverage may not be established until
 *       producer outputs are INDEPENDENTLY BOUND AND VERIFIED, by something other
 *       than the caller that registered them. This is a precondition on that
 *       work, not a caveat about it.
 *
 * The observed links ARE returned alongside, because they are real evidence and
 * a reader should be able to see them; they are simply not a coverage claim.

-- 9. The writers.
--
-- Each one derives its actor, validates the tenant, serializes by natural
-- identity, enforces its compare-and-swap, verifies every digest it is handed by
-- RECOMPUTING it, and returns a readback rebuilt from the committed-shape row in
-- the same transaction. None of them accepts an actor, a tenant, a clock or a
-- prior state from its caller.
--
-- REPLAY BEFORE STATE. Every writer below calls ops.f01_claim_idempotency — and
-- therefore ops.f01_replay_outcome — BEFORE it reads any current pointer or
-- evaluates any compare-and-swap. That ordering is load-bearing rather than
-- incidental: a settled key must return its stored result even though the world
-- has moved on since, and a replay that ran after the CAS would raise
-- f01_stale_* for a request that had already succeeded. Do not hoist a state
-- read, a CAS or a policy comparison above the claim.
--
-- THE LOCK HIERARCHY, and it is acyclic. Every advisory lock any writer takes
-- appears in exactly one tier, and no writer ever takes a lock from a lower tier
-- before one from a higher tier. A new writer, or a new lock in an existing one,
-- MUST slot into this order or the deadlock freedom below stops being true.
--
--   tier 1  f01:request:<tenant>:<key>            (f01_replay_outcome; shared
--           with the private claim, and re-entrant within one transaction, so a
--           caller that probes for a replay and then writes does not self-block)
--   tier 2  f01:policy:<tenant>                   (exclusive in f01_install_policy;
--           SHARED in f01_apply_observation, f01_record_proposal and
--           f01_record_deletion_evaluation, which read the policy but never move it)
--   tier 3  f01:field:<tenant>:<entity>:<field>   (f01_apply_observation)
--           f01:artifact:<identity tuple>         (f01_record_artifact)
--           f01:artifact-retention:<tenant>:<artifact digest>   [tier 3a]
--                                                 (f01_record_hold,
--           f01_record_deletion_evaluation AND f01_register_derivative_link —
--           deliberately the SAME key for all three, so that neither a hold nor
--           a derivative registration can land underneath a deletion evaluation
--           that has already read the inventory and the coverage it will be
--           bound to. f01_record_proposal takes it too, because it registers a
--           derivative link of its own, and so does the document writer once it
--           registers one)
--           f01:document:<tenant>:<document_id>   [tier 3b] (f01_record_document)
--   tier 4  f01:hold:<tenant>:<hold_id>           (f01_record_hold)

--                                                  f01_record_document)
--
-- TIER 3 IS ORDERED INTERNALLY: RETENTION BEFORE DOCUMENT, and that ordering is
-- what keeps this acyclic now that one writer takes two tier-3 keys. The document
-- writer, when the version it is completing is DERIVED, acquires
-- f01:artifact-retention: (3a) and only then f01:document: (3b) and only then
-- f01:derivative: (4) — for the same reason f01_record_proposal takes the
-- retention key: a link must not land underneath a deletion evaluation that has
-- already read the artifact's coverage and bound its record to the digest of it.
--
-- WHY THE BACK EDGE CANNOT EXIST. No other writer takes f01:document: at all, so
-- no other writer can hold 3b while waiting for 3a, and every writer that takes
-- f01:artifact-retention: takes it FIRST among tier 3 and above. The remaining
-- tier-3 keys — f01:field: and f01:artifact: — are taken by writers that take no
-- second tier-3 key. Tier 4 keys are disjoint from each other and no writer takes
-- two of them. The observed acquisition orders are therefore exactly 1→2, 1→2→3,
-- 1→2→3→4, 1→3, 1→3→4 and 1→3a→3b→4, which is a strict order with no edge from a
-- lower tier — or from a later tier-3 key — back to an earlier one. Hence no
-- cycle, hence no deadlock between any two F01 writers.
--
-- A WRITER THAT TAKES BOTH TIER-3 KEYS MUST TAKE THEM IN THAT ORDER. This is the
-- one place that constraint is written down; a future writer that took the
-- document key before the retention key would reintroduce the cycle this note
-- exists to rule out.
--
-- ONE CLAIM PER TRANSACTION-TIER-1 KEY. f01_record_proposal writes a derivative
-- link through the PRIVATE ops.f01_insert_derivative_link rather than by calling
-- the public writer, precisely so that it does not take a second tier-1 request
-- lock after a tier-2 policy lock. Its own idempotency key already covers both
-- records: they are written in one transaction and replayed as one outcome.

 * THE FOUR RECORDS ARE FOUR RELATIONS, and this function refuses a shape where
 * one stands in for another: an accepted change writes the current-state
 * transition AND the append-only event AND the mutation receipt AND advances
 * current state, or none of them lands. A conflict writes the visible
 * reconciliation item and nothing else. A refusal writes neither.
 *
 * BOTH COMPARE-AND-SWAPS ARE ENFORCED. The stored policy digest and the stored
 * current-state digest must still be the ones the decision was taken against;
 * either having moved refuses, so a concurrent observation cannot land on a
 * picture of the record that has since changed underneath it.

-- 10. Grants.
--
-- NO DIRECT RUNTIME DML, anywhere. The runtime principal receives EXECUTE on the
-- nine operation functions and SELECT on the relations for diagnosis; every
-- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE arrives through a security-definer writer
-- or does not arrive at all.
--
-- PARENT WIRING. The runtime role name below is the one thing this file cannot
-- know from inside the capsule. The DO block applies the grants only to roles
-- that already exist and creates none, so the migration is additive and safe to
-- apply before the parent confirms the exact name.
--
-- THE READER'S EXCLUSION LIST IS TEN NAMES AND IT IS MIRRORED IN THREE PLACES:
-- here, in the posture readback in section 11, in the SQL fixture's
-- least-privilege block, and in the local PostgreSQL gate's READER_FORBIDDEN.
-- The eight writers are the obvious part; f01_replay_outcome and
-- f01_require_authority_principal are the two that a mirror written from the
-- writer list alone will miss, and a mirror that misses them fails a CORRECT
-- schema. Anything added to or removed from this list has to move in all four.
--
-- f01_register_derivative_link is a WRITER, so the reader is excluded from it
-- like the rest; carr_writer KEEPS it, because the ordinary evidence principal
-- is exactly the trusted producer identity the settled decision names.
-- f01_insert_derivative_link is a PRIVATE helper and joins the claim/settle pair
-- that nobody may execute at runtime.
--
-- THE PRIVATE LIST NAMES ONE FUNCTION THIS FILE DOES NOT CREATE:
-- f01_insert_document_source_provenance, the document-source seam's inserter. It
-- arrives with the document hunk, and the loop below iterates over whatever
-- ops.f01_% functions EXIST when this file runs — so if this file is applied
-- after that hunk, an unnamed helper would be granted to every runtime role and
-- the posture readback in section 11 would not notice. Naming it in both places
-- costs nothing in a database that does not have it yet.

-- Part 2 of 2: ops/document-derivative-registration.candidate.sql, verbatim
-- except the psql-only line noted in the header.
-- ===========================================================================
-- DoctorCRE V5-F01 — the DOCUMENT half of the derivative-registration rule.
-- A CANDIDATE. NOT A MIGRATION. NOT APPLIED BY ANYTHING IN THIS CHANGE.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS. The additive relation, the private writer, three pure text
-- helpers and the forward-replacement of three existing objects, which together
-- give a derived DOCUMENT VERSION the same provenance edge a parsed proposal
-- already has: registered in the same transaction that completes the derivative,
-- or the derivative does not complete.
--
-- THE THREE FORWARD-REPLACEMENTS, each CREATE OR REPLACE over an object domain.sql
-- installed, none of them a DROP of anything but the writer this file supersedes:
--   ops.f01_guard_direct_dml()          one added alternative in the writer list
--   ops.f01_reserved_derivative_kinds() one added kind, the other kept (section 1.1)
--   ops.f01_record_document()           the four-argument form dropped and replaced
--                                       by the six-argument one (section 5)
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT, and the parent must supply separately:
--   * A MIGRATION. There is no ordinal, no ledger entry, no SCAC registration and
--     no frontier reservation here. The file name carries no number on purpose.
--     Security attribution owns 0499/v25 and the F01 successor is v26; this hunk
--     belongs inside whatever the parent binds, and it binds nothing itself.
--   * AN APPLY. Nothing in this change runs it. It has not been executed against
--     any database, disposable or otherwise, and no claim is made here that it
--     does. The local PostgreSQL gate is the parent's to point at it.
--   * POLICY. No retention rule, no producer allow-list, no field owner, no
--     document class, no OneDrive item and no object-storage key is inserted,
--     defaulted or implied. It ships zero rows.
--   * LEGACY CHANGE. public.record_source and public.document are not read,
--     altered, backfilled, renamed, dual-written or referenced.
--   * EXTERNAL EFFECT. No provider call, no byte deletion, no notification, no
--     scheduler, no extension install, no role creation. The only grants it makes
--     are the posture every comparable F01 object already has: SELECT on the new
--     relation and EXECUTE on the new readers and pure text helpers for the four
--     runtime principals, EXECUTE on the replaced writer for the three that held
--     it before, and EXECUTE on the new private helper for nobody at all.
--
-- WHY A FORWARD REPLACEMENT RATHER THAN A NEW WRITER. The settled rule is that a
-- derived record registers its source BEFORE it is considered complete. A second,
-- optional "also register the document's source" writer would leave the ORIGINAL
-- ops.f01_record_document as a path that completes a derived document with no
-- provenance edge — which is the whole thing this exists to prevent. So the
-- four-argument form is DROPPED and replaced by a six-argument form that cannot
-- be called without a provenance statement, exactly as ops.f01_record_proposal's
-- four-argument form was dropped when its third envelope became mandatory. Two
-- overloads would also make the four-argument call ambiguous.
--
-- EVERY OLD GUARD IS PRESERVED. The replaced writer keeps its digest
-- recomputation, its actor derivation, its document advisory lock, its
-- prior-digest compare-and-swap against BOTH the stored current pointer and the
-- record's own claim, its idempotency claim-before-state ordering, and its
-- verified readback. Nothing anywhere in this file is relaxed: every replacement
-- adds a check or a name and removes none.
--
-- THE FOUR THINGS THIS FILE MAKES UNSAYABLE:
--   1. A document version recorded with no statement about where it came from.
--   2. A derived document version recorded without its ops.f01_derivative_link
--      row, or with one that names some other document or some other source.
--   3. A provenance row that claims coverage, claims to be an exhaustive
--      inventory, claims to permit a deletion, or admits that its source artifact
--      was inferred from the document's own bytes or its OneDrive identity.
--   4. A PUBLIC registration of an 'f01_document_version' link. That identity is
--      "<document_id>:<version_no>" — predictable before the document exists — over
--      an append-only unique index with no release path, so a caller could
--      otherwise pre-claim it and make the genuine completion of that version
--      conflict for ever, or repoint an already-completed one. Section 1.1
--      forward-replaces ops.f01_reserved_derivative_kinds() with BOTH internally
--      produced kinds. The private inserter is unaffected, which is exactly the
--      point: this file's own writer still registers the link, and nothing outside
--      the schema can.
--
-- WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH. Coverage. ops.f01_derivative_coverage answers
-- 'unknown' for every artifact and this file does not change it: registering
-- where one document came from says nothing about whether some other derivative
-- of that artifact exists unregistered. Deletion still fails closed, and
-- ops.f01_stored_derivatives still returns NULL.
--
-- ORDER OF APPLICATION, AND WHAT NOTHING HERE CAN CATCH. This file assumes
-- domain.sql has already been applied in the same database. It must never be
-- applied again afterwards, and — said plainly, because an earlier revision of
-- this header claimed the opposite — NOTHING IN THIS FILE DETECTS IT IF IT IS.
-- Every check in section 6 runs once, while THIS file is applying. A later
-- domain.sql re-apply happens after they have all passed and re-runs only
-- domain.sql's own checks, which do not know this hunk exists. Three things break
-- silently in that order:
--
--   1. domain.sql's grant loop hands ops.f01_insert_document_source_provenance —
--      a private helper — to every runtime role, and its posture check (b) does
--      not notice, because both enumerate the private helpers BY NAME.
--   2. domain.sql's CREATE OR REPLACE restores the OLD ops.f01_guard_direct_dml,
--      whose writer alternation does not name that helper, so every provenance
--      insert is refused as direct DML. This one fails closed and loudly.
--   3. domain.sql's CREATE OR REPLACE restores ops.f01_reserved_derivative_kinds()
--      without 'f01_document_version', reopening the public pre-claim this file
--      closes, and restores the FOUR-ARGUMENT ops.f01_record_document beside the
--      six-argument one — a path that completes a derived document with no
--      provenance edge, which is the whole thing this file exists to prevent.
--
-- So the parent's domain.sql edits are MANDATORY rather than tidy-up, and they are
-- enumerated in section 6. Until they land, the only thing that catches the wrong
-- order is the SQL fixture, which runs after both files and asserts the private
-- helper is unreachable — a detection at test time, not a guard at install time.
--
-- REQUIRES PostgreSQL 13 or later and a UTF8 database, for the same reasons
-- domain.sql does; both are asserted there and not re-asserted here.

-- (psql-only ON_ERROR_STOP line removed: psycopg applies this file)

-- ===========================================================================
-- 0. Preconditions, or refuse. This file extends a schema; it does not create

-- 1.1 The reserved-kind list, forward-replaced.
--
-- THE PUBLIC SURFACE MUST REFUSE A KIND THIS SCHEMA'S OWN WRITER PRODUCES, and
-- from this file on that is two kinds rather than one.
--
-- WHAT WAS OPEN. ops.f01_record_document below registers an ops.f01_derivative_link
-- row whose identity is ('f01_document_version', '<document_id>:<version_no>').
-- That identity is PREDICTABLE — it is the document's own name and version, not a
-- digest of anything the server holds — and the identity index is unique per
-- (tenant, kind, id) over an append-only table with no release path. Until this
-- replacement, any principal holding EXECUTE on the public
-- ops.f01_register_derivative_link could:
--
--   * PRE-CLAIM ('f01_document_version', 'some-doc:1') against an artifact of its
--     choosing BEFORE that document version was ever written, after which the
--     genuine completion of that version raises f01_derivative_source_conflict for
--     ever — and a provenance edge asserting a document came from an artifact it
--     did not sits in the record layer meanwhile; or
--   * attempt to REPOINT an already-registered document version at another
--     artifact, which refuses today but for the wrong reason and only because the
--     first link happened to exist first.
--
-- THE LIST IS REPLACED, NOT APPENDED TO, and it must therefore keep every kind it
-- already had. CREATE OR REPLACE substitutes the whole body: dropping
-- 'f01_parsed_proposal' here would reopen exactly the hole that guard was written
-- for. Both kinds are named below and the fixture asserts both.
--
-- THE PRIVATE HALF IS UNTOUCHED, deliberately. ops.f01_insert_derivative_link
-- consults no reserved list, because it is reached only from inside a definer
-- writer in this schema — ops.f01_record_proposal for proposals, and
-- ops.f01_record_document for documents — which is the only place these kinds are
-- legitimately produced. Refusing there would break the very paths that must
-- write them.
--
-- CREATE OR REPLACE preserves the existing ACL, so the grants domain.sql made on
-- this function still stand and this file widens nothing.

-- 1.2 The text rules, as functions, so there is one copy of each.
--
-- WHY THESE EXIST AT ALL. The Node module refuses malformed free text before it
-- ever builds a record; these are the half that holds whatever calls the writer.
-- They are used BOTH by the CHECK constraints in section 2 and by the named
-- refusals in the private inserter in section 4, so the predicate has exactly one
-- copy and a caller still learns what it did rather than reading a constraint name.
--
-- THE LENGTH BOUND IS COUNTED IN UTF-16 CODE UNITS, NOT CODE POINTS, and that is
-- the whole reason f01_docsource_utf16_length exists rather than a plain length().
-- JavaScript's String.prototype.length counts UTF-16 code units, so the module
-- refuses a basis statement of 512 astral characters — 1024 units. PostgreSQL's
-- length() counts CODE POINTS and would have admitted it: the SQL half would then
-- be SILENTLY WEAKER than the Node half for exactly the text most likely to be
-- pasted in from somewhere else. The arithmetic below is
--
--     utf16 = 2 * code_points - non_astral_code_points
--           = code_points + astral_code_points
--
-- which is the same number String.prototype.length reports, for every string. The
-- Node suite pins both halves of that equality.
--
-- WRITTEN AS UNICODE ESCAPES, NEVER AS LITERAL CHARACTERS. A file that embedded
-- the zero-width and bidirectional characters it exists to refuse would read as
-- binary to file(1), rg and git diff, and the schema that refuses invisible
-- characters in its inputs could not itself be reviewed as text. The classes below
-- are U& literals with UESCAPE '!' rather than backslash escapes, for two reasons:
-- the file stays plain ASCII either way, and '!' cannot be confused with the
-- REGEX's own backslash. A bracket expression written with backslash-u escapes has
-- to be read twice to work out which layer resolves it, and read wrong — one
-- backslash where two were meant, or two where one was — it quietly matches a
-- literal backslash and the letter u instead of the character nobody can see. The
-- string lexer resolves the U& form before the regex engine is handed anything, so
-- the pattern contains exactly the characters named here and nothing else.
--
-- ONE JS RULE IS ABSENT ON PURPOSE. The module refuses unpaired surrogates; a
-- PostgreSQL text value in a UTF8 database cannot contain one, so there is nothing
-- here to check and a check would be theatre.

-- 2. The relation.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS. One document VERSION's statement about where that version
-- came from. Exactly one row per stored document version, written in the same
-- transaction as the version itself.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL, given ops.f01_derivative_link. Because an ABSENT link has
-- always meant nothing. A document with no link row is indistinguishable from a
-- document nobody registered, a document produced before this rule existed, and a
-- document that genuinely has no corporate source because somebody wrote it here.
-- Those are three different facts and the record layer has to be able to say
-- which. So the derived case gets a link row AND a provenance row; the other two
-- get a provenance row that says, in bytes that hash, which of them is true.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS NOT. It is not coverage, not an inventory, not a deletion
-- permission, and never an inference. The four claims a derivative link may not
-- make are refused here too, and two more are added: a row may not say its source
-- artifact was inferred from the document's own bytes, and may not say it was
-- inferred from the OneDrive identity. Both are stored as false and CHECK-bound,
-- so the prohibition is a property of the row rather than a promise in a handler.

-- 2.1 Every CHECK constraint, added BY NAME.
--
-- WHY NOT INSIDE THE CREATE TABLE. Because CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leaves an
-- already-installed table completely untouched, constraints written inside it
-- reach FRESH DATABASES ONLY. On any database where the table already exists —
-- which, for a relation nothing else creates, means one where an earlier revision
-- of this same file was applied — a predicate that was tightened, corrected or
-- added since would silently not be there, and the apply would still report
-- success. That is the worst of both worlds: a constraint everybody believes is
-- enforced and nothing enforces. DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS followed by ADD
-- CONSTRAINT lands on both, and there is still exactly ONE copy of each predicate
-- in this file.
--
-- THE ADDS ARE VALIDATING, deliberately, and this is the one place that choice
-- could bite. domain.sql uses NOT VALID where it tightens a constraint over rows
-- written before the tightening existed, because aborting a whole schema apply to
-- say something about history helps nobody. Here the calculus is the opposite: any
-- row in this table was written by an earlier revision of the writer three
-- sections below, under this same contract, so a row that fails is a row this
-- file's own writer produced and could produce again. That aborts the apply, by
-- name, which is the correct and loud failure. A future revision that genuinely
-- tightens a predicate against rows it cannot re-derive must make that call then,
-- in that revision, and say so.
--
-- COLUMNS ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS will not add a
-- column to an existing table either, and no loop below does. This revision adds
-- none; a revision that does must ship an explicit ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN, and
-- the absence of one here is a statement rather than an oversight.

-- 5. record-document-identity, forward-replaced.
--
-- THE FOUR-ARGUMENT FORM IS DROPPED, not left beside this one. Two overloads
-- would make the four-argument call ambiguous AND would leave a path that
-- completes a derived document with no provenance edge, which is the whole thing
-- this exists to prevent. This is the same move ops.f01_record_proposal made when
-- its derivative-link envelope became mandatory.
--
-- THE LOCK ORDER, and it is an AMENDMENT the parent must re-review against the
-- hierarchy stated in domain.sql section 9. That note says no writer takes two
-- tier-3 keys. This one does, when the document is derived:
--
--   tier 1   f01:request:<tenant>:<key>                     (the idempotency claim)
--   tier 3a  f01:artifact-retention:<tenant>:<source digest> (derived documents only)
--   tier 3b  f01:document:<tenant>:<document_id>
--   tier 4   f01:derivative:<tenant>:<kind>:<id>            (derived documents only)
--
-- WHY THAT IS STILL ACYCLIC. The two tier-3 keys are taken in a FIXED order —
-- retention before document, never the reverse — and no other writer takes
-- f01:document: at all, so no other writer can hold it while waiting for
-- f01:artifact-retention:. Every writer that takes f01:artifact-retention:
-- (f01_record_hold, f01_record_deletion_evaluation, f01_register_derivative_link,
-- f01_record_proposal and this one) acquires it FIRST among tier 3 and above. The
-- observed acquisition orders therefore remain a strict order with no back edge.
--
-- WHY THE RETENTION KEY AT ALL. For the same reason f01_record_proposal takes it:
-- this writer registers a derivative link, and a link must not land underneath a
-- deletion evaluation that has already read the artifact's coverage and bound its
-- record to the digest of it.
--
-- EVERY OLD CHECK IS KEPT: the record-digest recomputation, the derived actor,
-- the document advisory lock, the two-sided compare-and-swap against the stored
-- current pointer AND the record's own prior claim, the current-pointer upsert
-- and the verified readback.
--
-- WHICH REFUSAL ARRIVES FIRST, said plainly because the fixture asserts it and a
-- reader would otherwise expect the other one. A second completion of a document
-- version that already exists cannot reach ops.f01_insert_derivative_link's
-- f01_derivative_source_conflict, because the document version is inserted first
-- and ops.f01_document_version_identity_uq — unique on (tenant, document_id,
-- version_no) — refuses it there. The link identity and the document identity are
-- the same identity by construction: derivative_id IS document_id || ':' ||
-- version_no. So through THIS writer the (kind, id) conflict is unreachable for
-- documents, and that is a strengthening rather than a gap: there is no order in
-- which a second, contrary statement about a stored version lands. The conflict
-- refusal still guards every other producer's kinds, through the public surface
-- and through ops.f01_record_proposal, and the fixture proves it there rather than
-- pretending to prove it here.

-- 6. Grants, and the posture readback.
--
-- THIS FILE GRANTS NOBODY ANYTHING THEY DID NOT ALREADY HAVE. The replaced
-- ops.f01_record_document lost its ACL with the DROP, so its previous grants are
-- restored exactly: carr_writer and the two authority logins may execute it,
-- carr_reader may not. The two new read functions and the three pure text helpers
-- follow the read posture every other F01 reader has — they decide nothing, hold
-- nothing and answer about their argument alone, and the local gate expects every
-- ops.f01_* function that is not a private helper or a guard to be reachable by
-- all four principals. The new private helper receives EXECUTE from nobody, ever,
-- exactly like ops.f01_insert_derivative_link.
--
-- ops.f01_reserved_derivative_kinds is REPLACED rather than created, so it keeps
-- the ACL domain.sql gave it. It appears in the loops below anyway: a function this
-- file changed the meaning of should have its posture re-asserted here rather than
-- assumed from another file.
--
-- PARENT WIRING, and it is a real obligation rather than a note. Each of these is
-- a place a name is enumerated BY HAND, so none of them knows about this hunk
-- until somebody adds it:
--
--   domain.sql section 10 grant loop      the private-helper skip list
--       f01_claim_idempotency, f01_settle_idempotency, f01_insert_derivative_link
--       + f01_insert_document_source_provenance
--   domain.sql section 11 check (b)       the same three names again, + the same
--                                         addition
--   domain.sql section 9.4.1              ops.f01_reserved_derivative_kinds() must
--                                         name 'f01_document_version' as well as
--                                         'f01_parsed_proposal' (section 1.1 here)
--   domain.sql section 1 guard            f01_guard_direct_dml's writer alternation
--                                         must name insert_document_source_provenance
--   domain.sql section 9.5                ops.f01_record_document must BE the
--                                         six-argument form, not be re-created as
--                                         the four-argument one beside it
--   ops/record-source-authority-local-pg-gate.py
--       PRIVATE_HELPERS                   add f01_insert_document_source_provenance.
--                                         THIS IS THE MIRROR THAT MATTERS: the gate
--                                         expects EXECUTE=true for every ops.f01_*
--                                         function that is not a private helper, a
--                                         guard, or on a role exclusion list, so a
--                                         correctly private helper that is missing
--                                         from PRIVATE_HELPERS makes the gate FAIL a
--                                         correct schema. READER_FORBIDDEN is NOT the
--                                         list for it — that one is about the eight
--                                         writers plus f01_replay_outcome and
--                                         f01_require_authority_principal, and adding
--                                         a private helper there would still leave
--                                         carr_writer expected to hold EXECUTE on it.
--       REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS                optional, and worth it: naming the new
--                                         helper and the two readers there is what
--                                         stops a schema that shipped the table but
--                                         not the writer from passing vacuously.
--   mcp-server/test/record-source-authority-postgres.sql

-- NOTHING BELOW CATCHES A LATER domain.sql RE-APPLY. The readback at the foot of
-- this section runs once, while this file applies, and it is a hard stop for what
