-- Joe's 2026-09-29 classification: Musicologie C-161 is the only national
-- account. C-204 and C-205 entered through create-national-account on
-- 2026-08-15 but have no franchisee clients or deals. Preserve both client
-- records and their creation history; remove only the incorrect account role.
-- This is a reviewed correction path, not an authorization to apply it.
-- rollback: forward-only; reversing the recorded human correction requires a
-- reviewed corrective migration with fresh census and linked-work guards.
