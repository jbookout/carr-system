--
-- Let the Worker's writer login reach the Tour mutation functions.
--
-- WHY (2026-09-23, feeding the Sapala pre-tour, Joe: "turn the hosted tour
-- surface on and feed it sapala"). ops.tour_server_actor_id() is the one actor
-- gate that 12 Tour mutation functions call (create_tour_domain,
-- append_tour_route_version, append_tour_route_stop, the cheat-sheet writes,
-- and the rest). Since 0429 it accepted a writer session only when
-- session_user was LITERALLY 'carr_writer' or 'carr_authority'. Those are
-- NOLOGIN bundle roles: nothing ever authenticates as them. The deployed
-- Worker authenticates as app_writer, a member of carr_writer, so every
-- non-authority Tour mutation in Production raised "tour mutation requires an
-- authority connection or sponsored writer session". create-tour-domain from a
-- sponsored Claude session was the first real call and it failed exactly so.
--
-- WHAT CHANGES. One more accepted session shape, by MEMBERSHIP rather than by
-- name: a login that is a member of carr_writer or carr_authority resolves its
-- actor from carr.acting_actor_slug, which the Worker sets server-side for every
-- sponsored write (mcp.js). This is the same membership test 0517 and 0532a
-- already use for writer sessions. Unchanged: the carr_authority_* branch still
-- derives the actor from the login name and is checked first; the actor must
-- still be a non-empty bounded slug; any other session is still refused.
-- EXECUTE grants are untouched, so who may call each Tour function is exactly
-- what 0429 and later migrations granted.
