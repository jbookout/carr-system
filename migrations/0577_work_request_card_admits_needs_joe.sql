-- 0577_work_request_card_admits_needs_joe.sql
--
-- The gap this closes: 0575/0576 added answer-work-request-for-joe, the sole
-- verb that resolves a needs_joe Work Request -- but ops.work_request_card
-- (latest full body: migration 0493) refused to READ one. Its state filter
-- named only ('captured','triaged','ready','declined','superseded'), so the
-- app's Model Room card for the exact row Joe is about to answer came back
-- work_request_not_found, and the answer verb's own base_version and
-- acceptance_criteria -- the two things scope_confirmed is supposed to
-- revalidate -- had no read path at all. "authorized human decision and
-- evidence recorded; scope and acceptance criteria revalidated" cannot be
-- honoured by a human who cannot see the criteria being revalidated.
--
-- Widening the state list alone would have been dead code. needs_joe is
-- reachable ONLY by a general or program row (ops.work_request_sourced_
-- capture_shape, 0426, never admits needs_joe for a sourced row -- see
-- 0575's own header), and every existing INNER JOIN and equality filter in
-- this function assumed the opposite: a sourced or program row, always
-- carrying organization_tenant_id='carr-internal' and a doctrine_section_id
-- pointing at a real, shared doctrine_section/doctrine_document pair. A
-- general row's organization_tenant_id and doctrine_section_id are NULL by
-- the same CHECK constraint's first branch. So three things move together,
-- not one:
--
--   * the doctrine_section / doctrine_document joins become LEFT joins, so a
--     general row's absent source does not eliminate the row entirely;
--   * source_current is coalesced to false rather than left to evaluate
--     against a null doctrine_section, so a card with no source reads as
--     "not current" rather than an ambiguous null;
--   * the row-level tenant check admits organization_tenant_id IS NULL,
--     mirroring the identical relaxation current-work-item's own query
--     already uses for the same reason (work-request-intake.js, "organization_
--     tenant_id is null or organization_tenant_id = $1");
--   * the visibility gate admits d.visibility IS NULL (no doctrine document
--     to have a visibility at all) alongside the existing 'shared' case;
--   * needs_joe admission is further scoped to doctrine_section_id IS NULL --
--     never merely to the state name. ops.work_request_sourced_capture_shape
--     (0426) already keeps a REAL sourced row out of needs_joe, but
--     program6-human-triage-gate.py and program6-sourced-routine-gate.py both
--     prove the card's own defense independently of that CHECK by forcing a
--     sourced row into needs_joe through a deliberate constraint bypass and
--     asserting the card still refuses it. A state-name-only widening would
--     have surfaced that manufactured row, because a sourced row's
--     doctrine_section_id is populated and the LEFT JOIN above no longer
--     excludes it on that basis alone.
--
-- Every one of these only WIDENS what the function returns for a row shape
-- (general, needs_joe) it previously could not return under ANY state list.
-- No existing sourced or program row's projection changes: for those rows
-- doctrine_section_id is always populated, so the joins still resolve a real
-- row, source_current's coalesce is a no-op (the expression it wraps was
-- already boolean, never null, when s exists), and the tenant/visibility
-- relaxations are pure OR-widenings over conditions those rows already
-- satisfied on the non-null side.
--
-- Signature and grants are unchanged: create or replace is used rather than
-- drop-then-create because the return table's columns are identical to
-- 0493's, and PostgreSQL preserves the function's existing grants across a
-- create-or-replace that does not touch the signature.
--
-- No explicit transaction control: from 0339 onward tools/migrate.py runs
-- each migration inside its own single transaction.
