-- 0348_pr_only_main_ruleset_control.sql
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. WR-000019 slice S3 retired hooks/git-writer-gate.py and
-- hooks/canonical-edit-gate.py, and ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json no
-- longer declares the git_writer or canonical_edit controls. The two rules
-- that named them (308ef1de, 4a53ff82) are reassigned in that same change to
-- a new control, pr_only_main_ruleset -- the PR-only main ruleset plus
-- required hosted CI that already carries the same property server-side
-- (a change cannot reach main without a reviewed PR), backed locally by
-- ops/githooks/pre-commit's existing refusal of a direct commit on main.
--
-- ops/control-catalog-parity-gate.py compares ops.enforcement_control_catalog
-- against exactly what ops/sync_control_catalog.py compiles from the map, so
-- a control the map declares that the table does not carry fails CI the
-- moment the map changes. This migration is the seed for the new row, and the
-- guarded retirement of the two rows the map no longer names -- the same
-- shape as migration 0290's retirement of ledger_boundary, applied twice.
--
-- WHY THE TWO OLD ROWS CANNOT SIMPLY BE LEFT BEHIND. An unreviewed row in this
-- table is an unreviewed claim about what counts as enforcement (rule
-- ab814a26), and the parity gate refuses to delete one itself for exactly
-- that reason -- it will not silently un-enforce a rule that might still be
-- bound to it.
--
-- A THIRD CONTROL NARROWS ITS EVIDENCE, THE SAME WAY 0290 NARROWED
-- record_home. loose_work's implementation also named
-- hooks/staging-attribution-gate.py, retired in the same slice; the map now
-- lists only hooks/loose-work-gate.py and hooks/staging-observation-tracker.py
-- for it. implementation_ref is compared string-for-string by
-- ops/control-catalog-parity-gate.py, so a map that no longer names the file
-- and a catalog row that still does is a DISAGREEMENT and fails the gate
-- exactly as an undeclared row does.
--
-- THE FOURTH THING THIS TOUCHES: ops.rule_delivery_activation_target.map_digest,
-- the stored preimage ops.set_rule_delivery_mode() compares the caller's
-- CARR_CHANGE_REASON-style expected digest against before it will flip
-- ops.rule_delivery_policy (migration 0317's cutover function; last refreshed
-- by migration 0332 to the map's PRE-slice-S3 sha256). Every edit this slice
-- made to ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json changed its bytes, so the
-- digest ops/rule-delivery-local-pg-acceptance.py now reads from
-- ops/config/rule-delivery-activation-overlay.v1.json's freshly re-pinned
-- base_map_sha256 no longer matches the nine stored rows, and the cutover
-- function raises 'activation map digest preimage differs'. This migration
-- refreshes map_digest on those same nine rows the same way 0332 did --
-- nothing else on the row changes, because nothing this slice touched names
-- session_boot, pack_delivery, or any of the nine reviewed rule ids (verified
-- against the branch diff; see the overlay file's own _note).
--
-- WHY IT IS SAFE TO RETIRE THEM HERE, checked by the database rather than
-- taken on trust, same three facts 0290 checked:
--   1. rule_controls in ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json names neither
--      git_writer nor canonical_edit any more, across all 219 active rules.
--   2. ops.rule_control_binding references control_key ON DELETE RESTRICT, so
--      a live binding would abort this migration instead of silently
--      un-enforcing a rule.
--   3. active_approved_control_immutable fires BEFORE DELETE and raises if
--      the key appears in any rule_approval_receipt for an active rule.
-- If either fact is wrong for either control, this migration fails loudly
-- (naming which one) rather than removing enforcement quietly.
