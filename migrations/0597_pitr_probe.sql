-- 0597: ops.pitr_probe — the rows bin/pitr-restore-proof.sh writes so it can
-- PROVE how recent a point production can be restored to (V5-F08, RPO cell).
--
-- WHY A DEDICATED TABLE. The provider exposes history retention but no "latest
-- restorable point", so the proof creates a disposable branch of production at
-- an instant T and checks what is on it. Reading a business row there is weak
-- evidence: business rows are rewritten, and nothing says one was committed at
-- a known instant. So the proof writes its OWN rows here: a POSITIVE probe at
-- least 60 s before T that must be on the branch, and a NEGATIVE probe at least
-- 5 s after T that must NOT be — the negative control that proves the branch
-- really is production at T rather than at some later point. No business table
-- is written by the proof; these rows are the only thing it writes.
--
-- THE DOOR. The only writer is ops.write_pitr_probe(role). The nonce and the
-- write instant are made HERE, server-side (gen_random_bytes, clock_timestamp),
-- so a caller can neither choose a nonce it already knows is on some branch nor
-- backdate a write. Rows are append-only: update, delete and truncate refuse.
--
-- NO RUNTIME ROLE GETS ANYTHING. The function is NOT security definer and is
-- granted to no runtime role; the table is granted to none either. The only
-- caller is the attended proof, on the owner connection it already holds to
-- read production and create the branch (the weekly restore rehearsal's
-- connection). A grant to carr_jobs would have widened a standing runtime
-- capability for a once-in-a-while attended check, and would have moved the
-- sealed capability census for nothing a runtime role needs. carr_backup reads
-- the table through the ops default privileges like every ops table, so probe
-- rows are in the nightly dump.
