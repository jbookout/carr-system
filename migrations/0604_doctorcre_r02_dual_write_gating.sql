-- DoctorCRE V5-R02 / PR #1245 review, item 5: ops.enqueue_job did not know
-- the V5-R02 workflow-cutover state machine (0602) existed at all. A
-- workflow mid-cutover -- already at single_write_authority or beyond, where
-- the NEW system is supposed to be the only writer -- could still have its
-- legacy schedule surfaces enqueue live jobs with no relationship to the
-- cutover plan's own stage or evidence ladder, defeating the whole point of
-- Q116's staged cutover. This migration re-creates ops.enqueue_job (owned by
-- migration 0498, already applied to production, so it can only be replaced
-- forward, never edited in place) with two additional gates that apply ONLY
-- when an active ops.workflow_cutover_plan exists for the exact
-- (definition_key, definition_version):
--
--   1. At stage single_write_authority or later, live-mode enqueue requires
--      proof the legacy side cannot also be writing: a
--      ops.legacy_schedule_disable_receipt for every
--      ops.legacy_schedule_surface_registry row of the workflow, or no
--      legacy surface registered at all. This is the same
--      "every legacy surface" anti-join ops.retire_workflow_cutover_plan
--      (0602, PR #1245 item 3) already uses -- single_write_authority is
--      exactly the point where that proof starts mattering, not only at
--      final retirement.
--   2. At the same stages, live-mode enqueue also requires a canary
--      ops.workflow_acceptance row accepted AFTER the plan most recently
--      transitioned into its current stage. Canary mode is never gated
--      here, and neither is any stage before single_write_authority (PR
--      #1245 re-review P1-a: gating them let merely opening a plan halt a
--      live workflow with no way to produce fresh evidence). Without this, one
--      canary acceptance recorded back at shadow_compare would silently keep
--      justifying live traffic through single_write_authority, cutover and
--      monitor -- each stage needs its OWN fresh acceptance evidence, not a
--      stale one reused across the whole cutover.
--
-- A workflow with no active cutover plan (the overwhelming majority) is
-- completely unaffected: both new blocks are gated on `found` from the
-- ops.workflow_cutover_plan lookup, and 0498's original shadow/canary/live
-- evidence ladder and duplicate_group exclusion are reproduced verbatim
-- below, unchanged.
--
-- SCAC: this is a security-definer function replacement, so it owes a
-- registry successor. Per the coordinator's updated numbering rule (this PR,
-- 2026-09-24): there are no pre-assigned SCAC versions any more, and the
-- successor for every function changed in this PR branch -- including this
-- one -- is sealed together at PR #1245 item 8, against origin/main's actual
-- newest version at merge time, not a number guessed now.

comment on function ops.enqueue_job(text, integer, timestamptz, jsonb, text, text) is
  'The only admission path into ops.job. 0334''s enabled-definition gate and shadow/canary/live evidence ladder, 0498''s duplicate_group exclusion, and (0604, PR #1245 item 5) the V5-R02 workflow-cutover gate: when an active ops.workflow_cutover_plan exists for this exact workflow identity, live mode at single_write_authority or later requires a disable receipt for every registered legacy surface and a canary acceptance row recorded since the plan entered its current stage. Earlier stages and canary mode are never gated by a plan.';
