-- THREE FORWARD-ONLY CORRECTIONS TO THE GATE ZERO OUTCOME SURFACE, each one a
-- blocking finding of the outside review that REFUSED the third Worker release
-- candidate 79dc6e5374072dff8f92acb24d31e5c447d13b0c on 2026-09-13.
--
-- WHY A NEW FILE AND NOT AN EDIT. Migrations 0502, 0503 and 0504 are APPLIED to
-- Production -- highest applied 0504, applied count 346 -- and the runner records
-- and re-checks each applied file's sha256. An applied file is history; a
-- correction is a new number. Nothing below touches those three files.
--
-- ── (1) THE TAGGED DIGEST (review finding 2) ─────────────────────────────────
--
-- 0502 recorded the outcome digest as a plain canonical-JSON sha256 over the
-- receipt object, and said so in its own comment as a NAMED ASSUMPTION: r7's
-- `receipt_payload_digest_rule` named domain tags for four schemas and was
-- SILENT on `consumer-gate-receipt.v1`, so the plain reading was taken and put on
-- the surface where one line could overturn it.
--
-- IT WAS OVERTURNED. Act 5 of accepted plan PLAN-a5059eb52474-v3
-- (sha256:a5059eb5247418d150a261c5501dcfa38b69b57512c2d44f02356b92c07893bc)
-- amended r7 on 2026-09-13 to declare this schema's payload digest as the TAGGED
-- preimage -- sha256 over the RFC8785/JCS serialization of the two-element array
-- whose first element is the domain-tag string `consumer-gate-receipt.v1` and
-- whose second is the twenty-one-field receipt -- and to state that a plain
-- digest over the receipt alone does NOT satisfy it. All 62
-- normalized-r7-design chunks were resealed and the packet is pinned at
-- 4379c60e9a4fefbcf044f4bc5a34e5a95c90f77b9adf348b6da7475e17d5e6d7. The plan's
-- own planned check 18 names either reader computing digest(receipt) as a
-- FAILURE CONDITION.
--
-- NO BACKFILL IS OWED AND NONE IS ATTEMPTED. ops.gate_zero_read_only_outcome is
-- empty in Production: the live run that writes the first row is act 13 of the
-- same plan and has not happened. A proof below asserts that emptiness rather
-- than assuming it, because a CREATE OR REPLACE that silently left rows carrying
-- a superseded recipe beside rows carrying the declared one is exactly the
-- divergence the readback exists to catch.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* TAGGED. ops.gate_zero_outcome_candidate_digest is
-- computed over a PROJECTION of the receipt -- five per-run values removed -- and
-- that projection is not a consumer-gate-receipt.v1, so r7's rule does not speak
-- about it. Tagging a projection with the schema name of the thing it is not
-- would be the misstatement. It stays plain here and plain in the gateway, and it
-- remains an idempotency comparison key rather than evidence.
--
-- ── (2) THE RETRY CONVERGES (review finding 3) ───────────────────────────────
--
-- The outcome row and its audit event are written by two different login roles
-- and therefore two different transactions; the seat's commits first. An outer
-- failure after it leaves an outcome with no event, and 0502's writer then
-- RAISED on any retry whose candidate-scoped projection had moved -- so the very
-- retry meant to heal the missing event could not run. The fallback branch now
-- returns the recorded row instead of raising. Nothing is replaced, no trigger is
-- weakened, and the full reasoning is inside the function below, beside the line
-- it replaces.
--
-- ── (3) THE READS A CANDIDATE FILING NEEDS (review finding 1) ────────────────
--
-- Standing-rule amendment 9(c) requires the release-candidate record to be filed
-- by the deploy wrapper under the AUTHORITY identity, because the Gate Zero seam
-- store reads a subject maker only out of a row whose GENERATED
-- `maker_authority_verified` column is true -- which 0504 makes true exactly when
-- the filing login was carr_authority_joe or carr_authority_dell. Filed on the
-- ledger writer, as the candidate was, 0504 marks the row unauthenticated and the
-- store correctly ignores it. That is the state the reviewer refused.
--
-- 0503 ALREADY ADMITTED THE WRITE HALF: `grant insert on table ops.release to
-- carr_authority`, inside the v26 mutation-registry successor that seals it,
-- plus the two column-scoped selects ops.release's INVOKER-RIGHTS completion
-- trigger reads. What was missing is the two reads the FILING COMMAND PATH
-- itself performs, and measured on Production on 2026-09-13 both were absent:
--
--     has_table_privilege('carr_authority','ops.service','select')  ->  false
--     has_table_privilege('carr_authority','ops.release','select')  ->  false
--
--   * tools/ops-record.py's service_id() runs `select id from ops.service where
--     key = %s` to resolve --service to its foreign key.
--   * its CANDIDATE_INSERT ends `returning id, release_key, maker_actor,
--     maker_session_user, maker_authority_verified`, and RETURNING requires
--     SELECT on the columns it returns.
--
-- Without both, moving the command onto the authority connection replaces a
-- silently-ignored row with a hard permission failure. They are granted below,
-- COLUMN-SCOPED to exactly those columns and nothing wider, and the width is
-- asserted rather than asserted-about.
--
-- NEITHER GRANT IS A NEW INGRESS, and that is measured rather than hoped: the
-- SIEP-11 mutation census counts only the ROW-CHANGING privileges, so a select
-- moves no category and this file is not a mutation-registry successor. 0503's
-- own header states the same rule for the two selects it carried. A proof below
-- re-asserts that this migration adds no update or delete anywhere.

-- NO EXPLICIT TRANSACTION CONTROL: from 0339 onward tools/migrate.py wraps the
-- whole file in ONE transaction, proof blocks included, so a failing proof below
-- rolls this DDL back with it.

  -- THE SHAPE THAT CANNOT RACE. ONE statement does the insert with the candidate
  -- key as its arbiter, so the conflict is resolved by the index rather than by
  -- a window between two statements: a concurrent inserter BLOCKS on the
  -- speculative insertion, and when the first committer commits the second takes
  -- the DO NOTHING branch and reads the committed row in the fallback select --
  -- which sees it, because each statement in READ COMMITTED takes a fresh
  -- snapshot. If the first transaction rolls back instead, the second inserts.
  -- Either way both callers receive the same durable row and neither receives an
  -- error.
  --
  -- AND A DIFFERENT RECEIPT FOR A RECORDED CANDIDATE IS STILL A CONFLICT, not a
  -- silent replace: the fallback select compares the recorded digest with the
  -- one offered and raises when they differ. The table is append-only and the
  -- first digest may already be bound by an acceptance.

  -- WHAT THE OUTSIDE REVIEWER FOUND. The write of the outcome and the write of

  -- transaction therefore commits first, and any failure after it -- the
  -- gateway's own comparison, the writer connection, the process -- leaves a
  -- recorded outcome with NO event. The recovery for that was always "retry, and
  -- the retry converges on the row and writes the event that was lost". It did
  -- not hold: the line that stood here RAISED whenever the retry's
  -- candidate-scoped projection differed from the recorded one, and evidence
  -- legitimately moves between two runs of one candidate -- a check conclusion
  -- lands, a predecessor outcome expires, a verdict flips. So the exact state the
  -- failure produces was the state no retry could repair. The reviewer's words:
  -- "an outcome-without-event state is reachable where subsequent retries using
  -- the now-current evidence cannot converge."
  --
  -- WHAT CONVERGING IS NOT. It is not a replace and it is not a widened
  -- permission. The FIRST receipt stays the stored one, its digest stays the
  -- recorded evidence, and the append-only row and statement triggers are
  -- untouched: nothing in this branch updates, deletes or re-inserts anything,
  -- and this transaction has written no row at all when it reaches here. A
  -- caller offering different evidence is told which outcome it converged onto
  -- rather than being handed a row it may mistake for its own -- the gateway
  -- recomputes both digests over the STORED receipt and reports
  -- `converged_onto_recorded_outcome` beside its own offered value -- and the
  -- NOTICE below puts the same fact in the server log, where an operator reading
  -- back a live run can see that a second run did not bind.
  --
  -- WHY NOT KEEP THE RAISE AND HEAL THE EVENT SOME OTHER WAY. Every other door
  -- is worse: a second writer function is a second EXECUTE grant and a new
  -- mutation capability; letting the gateway write the event off a parsed error
  -- string makes an error message load-bearing; and holding the seat's
  -- transaction open across the event write would let an ordinary writer's
  -- failure roll back an oracle's signature, which 0502 already refused.
