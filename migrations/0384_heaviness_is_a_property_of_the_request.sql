-- 0384 — heaviness stops reading the plan's wording.
--
-- ops.heavy_build_classification() built its signal text from the Work Request's
-- title, desired outcome and acceptance criteria AND from the proposed plan's
-- scope_summary. The last of those is the defect: the tier could be changed by
-- rewording the summary while the actual change stayed identical.
--
-- Observed 2026-08-27 on the snapshot seed-coverage guard. The same four-step
-- additive check classified heavy while its summary said "schema", and standard
-- once that word was replaced with "required-field contract". Same work, same
-- caps, same dependency refs, different tier. A session that learns this learns
-- to write around the gate instead of through it, which is worse than no gate.
--
-- NOTHING IS RELAXED. Every keyword signal still fires, on the same words, read
-- from the request itself. Every scale signal still reads the plan, because
-- acceptance-criteria count, dependency count and max_steps are facts about the
-- work's shape rather than about its prose. A request that was heavy before this
-- migration is heavy after it, whatever its plan says.
--
-- The parameter is kept in the signature so no caller changes.

  -- title, its desired outcome, its acceptance criteria -- plus the plan's SHAPE,
  -- which the scale signals below still read from caps and dependency refs.
  -- Nothing is relaxed: every signal that fired before still fires, and a request
