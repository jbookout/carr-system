// The local client's answer to a human_only refusal.
//
// THE MISREADING THIS EXISTS TO KILL. A human_only verb refuses the local CLI
// no matter who is at the keyboard, because the local-token path derives an
// AGENT principal — human:false is set server-side and, per src/index.js,
// nothing on the wire can change it. Only a token minted through the OAuth
// connector against a verified partner email carries human:true.
//
// The server's own hint names the two paths but never says that, so a human
// standing at the prompt reads "reconnect through the interactive OAuth
// connector" as something they might satisfy by trying again. On 2026-08-14 a
// session told Joe to run `./run.sh call activate-rule ...` himself; he ran it,
// was refused, and the round trip taught neither of us anything the first
// error could not have said.
//
// Printed by the local client, so it costs no Worker deploy.
