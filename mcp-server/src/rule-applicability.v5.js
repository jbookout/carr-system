// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F05, half one: rule taxonomy, typed applicability,
// coverage receipt, the supersession/override/exception graph, and the binding
// text vs code-enforced-constraint delivery rule.
//
// Four settled decisions live here in full — Q051 (where each kind of rule
// lives), Q064 (applicability from typed facts plus a coverage receipt), Q066
// (full binding text for anything a model interprets) and Q087 (explicit
// relation graph, no model conflict resolution).
//
// Q065 IS SPLIT AND THE DETERMINISTIC HALF IS HERE, not in the assembler: the
// possibly-binding bucket, the never-omit rule on a possible binding
// constraint, `read_only_exploration_permitted` and
// `consequential_action_permitted` are all computed by deriveRuleApplicability
// below. context-assembly.v5.js owns Q050 and Q068 outright, and owns the
// budget and mode half of Q065. The settled-decision table for ALL SEVEN sits
// here because this is the lower module and one home beats two copies.
//
// THE FIELD NAMED `decision` IS NOT THE WRITE GATE. A coverage receipt reads
// `decision: "allow"` whenever nothing hard-refused, which includes the case
// where facts are unknown and a possibly-binding rule is standing. The gate a
// call site must read before a consequential write is
// `consequential_action_permitted`, and `write_gate_field` says so in the
// receipt rather than in a comment a caller never opens.
//
// WHAT IS CODE HERE AND WHAT MUST ARRIVE AS TYPED POLICY:
//
//   IN CODE — the STRUCTURE Q051/Q064/Q087 settle. The six rule classes and
//   what each class may claim, the seven typed fact dimensions and the closed
//   vocabularies for five of them, the three relation kinds, the two control
//   effects, the delivery rule, and the graph checks. These are identity.
//
//   AS TYPED POLICY INPUT — every RULE. Its id, version, scope, owner, trigger,
//   enforcement, tests, retirement, binding text and relations. This module
//   ships no rule and no default for any of them; a missing, ambiguous,
//   duplicated, dangling or cyclic one refuses. The live rule store (166 shared
//   / 31 personal today) is the supplier; this module is not a second registry
//   and holds no rule of its own.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, following S01 and F01 deliberately:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is returned — a frozen result whose `decision` is "allow"
//     or "refuse" with a stable `reason_id`. A coverage receipt that blocks a
//     consequential action is an ANSWER the caller records, not an exception.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION throws V5F05Error. Unknown fields, unknown
//     vocabulary, open schemas, accessors, prototype keys, malformed Unicode,
//     dangling or cyclic relations and caller-asserted enforcement are not
//     policy questions; the module cannot read the input at all.
//
// THE ONE-AUTHORITY RULE. Every function is pure: no filesystem, no network, no
// database, no provider, no scheduler, no environment and no clock. Every
// evaluation that depends on time takes `now` from its caller. Nothing is
// stored, nothing is registered, nothing is activated; `V5_NO_EFFECTS` rides on
// every result to say so in the record.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not the rule store, not a router, not a daemon,
// not an admission service and not a production authority. It reuses
// artifact-trust.js for canonicalization and hashing, identity.js for the one
// server-held tenant and global-boundaries.v5.js for the no-effects marker, and
// reimplements none of them.

// Q087. Three relations, all explicit, all directed remover -> target.
//
// ALL THREE REMOVE. `supersedes`, `overrides` and `exception_to` differ in what
// they SAY and not in what they DO: each takes an otherwise-applicable rule out
// of the effective set. So the three admission conditions below apply to every
// one of them, not to exception_to alone.
//
//   1. BOUNDED SCOPE. A removing edge must carry a non-empty `scoped_validity`
//      predicate. A rule with `trigger: {}` and an `overrides` edge is an
//      unbounded repeal whatever the edge is called; refusing it only for
//      exception_to left the other two as the same silent repeal by another
//      name.
//   2. A REMOVAL-CAPABLE CLASS AGAINST A MANDATORY TARGET. Removing a mandatory
//      control is strictly stronger than declaring one, so a class that Q051
//      forbids from BEING mandatory may not DELETE a mandatory rule either.
//      Removal capability is mandatory capability; there is no second column to
//      drift out of step with `may_be_mandatory`.
//   3. NAMED AUTHORITY ACROSS OWNER OR SCOPE. A rule may remove another rule of
//      the SAME owner and the SAME scope: that is one owner revising their own
//      policy, which the compiler's other checks already validate. A rule
//      owned by someone else, or scoped elsewhere, may NOT — and this module
//      invents no dominance order to decide which of two owners wins. It fails
//      closed with `missing_relation_authority` and names the missing seam:
//      there is no verified grant that would let one owner or scope remove
//      another's control. See ruleKernelIntegrationGaps().
//   4. A NAMED SOURCE FOR THE REMOVER'S OWN TEXT. Same reasoning, applied to
//      provenance rather than to the class table: any rule holding a removing
//      edge must name the record, version and digest its text came from, so a
//      mandatory control cannot be deleted by a rule whose text is untraceable.
//      See compileRule.

 * made AFTER compilation and catches nothing at all about a fabrication, which
 * is the case that matters: every compile-time invariant — the class table, the
 * mandatory-control metadata, dangling and version-drifted edges, cycles, the
 * removing-edge conditions, and the removal ORDER that decides which rule
 * survives — only ever runs inside compileRuleUniverse.
 *
 * So the universe is REDERIVED. Its own rules are fed back through
 * compileRuleUniverse and the result must be byte-identical. A forged cyclic
 * graph, a hand-chosen removal order, a mandatory preference, a mandatory rule
 * with a null control effect or a rule with no provenance now fails on the
 * invariant it broke, whether or not the forger rehashed its work.
 *
 * WHY REDERIVATION AND NOT A PRIVATE BRAND. A module-private WeakSet or Symbol
 * is the stronger primitive and it is unusable here: the assembler's own
 * contract canonicalizes the whole request to BYTES and reads the JSON.parse of
 * them, so a compiled universe reaching assembleContextManifest is always a
 * fresh object with no identity to brand. A brand would have made the frozen-
 * bytes path — the property this slice is built on — impossible to satisfy.
 *
 * ORDERED, cheapest first, so the error a caller sees names what they did:
 *   1. Shape, closed keys and the digest, which is the ordinary
 *      edited-after-compilation case and deserves its own reason.
 *   2. Rederivation. Compile errors propagate with their own codes; a forged
 *      universe fails on the invariant it broke.
 *   3. The rederived digest must equal the presented one, which is what catches
 *      a self-consistent forgery whose rules are individually legal but whose
 *      removal order or derived fields are not the canonical ones.

// ONE MODE IS REACHABLE TODAY AND THE SECOND IS DELIBERATELY NOT. A rule the

// that a control enforced COMPLETELY IN CODE may be represented by its
// resulting constraint instead — and that affordance is unreachable here,
// because nothing this module can call establishes the antecedent.
//
// WHY THE CONSTRAINT MODE IS NOT EMITTED. `code_enforcement.evidence` is five
// strings supplied by the same caller that supplied the rule. The kernel can
// check that they are internally consistent — that the evidence names the
// control version the rule declares, that it is not dated in the future, that
// it is no older than a window the CALLER supplied. It cannot check that any of
// it happened. `verifier_id` is bound to no authority, and
// `implementation_digest`/`evidence_digest` are compared to nothing, because
// there is nothing here to compare them to. Delivering only a resulting
// constraint on that basis would hand the model less than the rule while
// telling the record the control was verified. So a code_enforced rule falls
// back to its FULL BINDING TEXT, and refuses outright when it has none.
//
// The caller's claim is not discarded — it rides along as
// `code_enforcement_claim`, stamped `evidence_verified_by_kernel: false`, so a
// downstream reader gets the evidence AND the fact that nobody checked it. The
// four internal-consistency verdicts are kept apart on purpose: absent
// evidence, evidence about a different control version, evidence from the
// future and evidence past the caller's own window are four different problems
// with four different fixes.

 *   1. The request must be readable and closed, tenant-bound, and carry a
 *      universe this module compiled and nobody has edited since.
 *   2. Read the typed facts. Unknown ones are collected, never assumed.
 *   3. Drop retired rules first, by their own expiry against `now`.
 *   4. Classify every remaining rule from its trigger: applicable, possibly
 *      binding (a dimension it needs is unknown) or not applicable, with the
 *      dimension-level reason either way.
 *   5. Walk the relation graph in the compiler's removal order. A rule removes
 *      its targets only if it is itself applicable AND still standing, and only
 *      inside its scoped validity. A remover that is merely POSSIBLY binding
 *      removes nothing and is recorded as a pending relation instead — the
 *      target stays effective. Every edge that did NOT fire is recorded in
 *      `skipped_relations` with the reason, so a removal nobody applied is
 *      visible rather than silent. This is ONE PASS in the compiler's order: a
 *      remover that was itself removed earlier in the pass does not fire, so in
 *      an A-supersedes-B-supersedes-C chain, C survives. The direction is
 *      fail-safe — an extra control, never a missing one — and the skipped edge
 *      is now in the receipt instead of being erased.
 *   6. Detect binding conflicts across the surviving mandatory set. Two rules
 *      requiring and forbidding one control key with no relation between them
 *      is refused; nothing here picks a winner.
 *   7. Deliver each effective and each possibly binding rule under Q066. Any
 *      delivery refusal is a blocking reason.
 *   8. Fold in semantic candidates as GUIDANCE. They are read after the
 *      effective set is final, which is why retrieval cannot remove a control:
 *      no code path exists in which a candidate is an input to step 4 or 5.
