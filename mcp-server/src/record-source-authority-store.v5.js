// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F01 phase 2: the persistence tail.
//
// The reviewed pure kernel in record-source-authority.v5.js decides. This module
// is what makes those decisions RECORDS: it loads the stored policy and the
// stored prior state, derives the actor and the instant from the server, runs
// the kernel unchanged, and hands the exact canonical preimages to the
// security-definer functions in ops (domain.sql) that own the compare-and-swap,
// the append-only history and the recomputed integrity.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, because it is the whole design:
//
//   KERNEL      Judges. Owns the vocabulary, the refusal matrix, the version
//               comparison and the exact bytes each record hashes to. Unchanged
//               and unwrapped: this module imports it and reimplements none of
//               it.
//   THIS MODULE Derives. Loads policy and prior state FROM THE DATABASE, takes
//               the actor from the authenticated transaction context and the
//               instant from the server, refuses caller authority injection
//               before any write, and builds the envelopes.
//   DATABASE    Enforces. Recomputes every digest from committed bytes, refuses
//               a stale policy or state digest, refuses a broken event chain,
//               refuses direct DML, and returns the readback.
//
// NOTHING IS TRUSTED IN ONE DIRECTION ONLY. The caller cannot supply a tenant, an
// actor, a clock, a prior artifact, a prior link, a current state, an evaluated
// decision or a digest. This module cannot supply the database an actor either:
// ops.f01_context_actor_slug() derives its own from the server-established
// transaction context, and every write here first verifies that the database's
// answer matches the handler's authenticated one, refusing when they differ.
//
// WHICH SCHEMA THIS MODULE REQUIRES, said plainly because it is now more than
// domain.sql. recordDocumentIdentity below calls the SIX-argument
// ops.f01_record_document and passes a provenance statement on every write, and
// it reads ops.f01_document_version_source. Both arrive with the document-source
// hunk (ops/document-derivative-registration.candidate.sql), applied AFTER
// domain.sql in the same database. Against a database carrying only the
// four-argument writer every document write fails on a missing function; the
// local gate names the missing functions up front rather than letting that
// surface later, and this module does not degrade to the old writer, because a
// path that completes a document with no statement about its origin is the exact
// thing the producer rule exists to remove.
//
// evaluateArtifactDeletion additionally reads ops.f01_retention_clock and
// ops.f01_retention_clock_digest, which arrive WITH domain.sql. They are what make
// a retention period start at the server-stamped instant the record layer took
// custody of an artifact rather than at the instant its source says it observed
// it; against a database carrying the older domain schema the deletion path fails
// on a missing function, and this module does not fall back to the source's
// timestamp, because measuring retention from a value a source can backdate is
// the defect the clock exists to remove.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE STILL IS NOT. It registers nothing: v5F01ToolRegistrations()
// below is a DESCRIPTION the parent may register from, and this file does not
// touch tools.js, mcp.js, the mutation registry or any generated catalog. It
// performs no provider call, sends nothing, deletes no bytes and completes no
// acceptance. F01 remains incomplete until the parent lands integration, the
// SCAC v26 surface, the disposable-database proof, CI and review.

  /**
   * Bind ONE derived record to the exact stored artifact it came from.
   *
   * WHO MAY WRITE ONE. The authenticated producer principal, derived from the
   * transaction context exactly like every other write here and checked against
   * the handler's own. There is no `trusted: true`, no producer allow-list a
   * caller can name itself into, and no path by which a reader becomes a
   * producer: ops.f01_register_derivative_link refuses a read-only principal in
   * its own body, and the grant loop never gives one EXECUTE on it.
   *
   * WHAT ONE MEANS, and it is deliberately narrow. "This derivative came from
   * that artifact." It does not mean the artifact's derivatives are now known,
   * it does not make an absent link an absent derivative, and it permits no
   * deletion of anything. Those claims are refused in the record itself, in the
   * result, and in the CHECK constraints on the stored row.
   *
   * NOR DOES IT MEAN THE DERIVATIVE EXISTS. Nothing here resolves the named
   * derivative or checks its bytes: the source artifact is LOADED, the derivative
   * is taken on the producer's word. That residual is safe only while coverage is
   * unknown, and it is written down at the two other places that would have to
   * change — the kernel's registration header and ops.f01_derivative_coverage —
   * as a precondition on ever establishing coverage, not a note about it.
   *
   * KINDS THIS CONTRACT PRODUCES ITSELF ARE REFUSED HERE, before any statement
   * runs. A caller cannot register an `f01_parsed_proposal` link: that kind is
   * written only by recordParsedProposal, whose derivative identity is a digest a
   * caller can predict, over an append-only unique identity with no release path.
   * ops.f01_register_derivative_link refuses the same kind in its own body — the
   * two are independent, as with every other guard in this seam — but the refusal
   * a caller should meet is this one, which names the reason instead of raising.
