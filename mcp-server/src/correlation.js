// CARR MCP server — correlation id middleware (Program 3, Gap A, 2026-08-14).
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The production-maturity baseline's observability
// contract, verbatim: "One correlation ID connects UI request, Worker route,
// record verb, database operation, agent session, approval, release, and
// incident." Before this file, the Worker had none — grep for "correlation"
// across mcp-server/src/*.js returned zero hits. No route read an incoming
// id, generated one when absent, echoed one back, or made one available to
// anything downstream.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS: a small, standalone module — no `cloudflare:` import, no
// database driver — so it can be loaded and tested under plain `node --test`
// (index.js itself cannot: it pulls in @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider,
// which resolves a `cloudflare:` specifier the Node loader refuses outside
// the Workers runtime). Four pieces:
//
//   isValidCorrelationId(value)   — pure format check, a standard UUID shape.
//   correlationIdFor(request)     — read x-correlation-id if present and
//                                    valid, else mint a fresh one. Garbage is
//                                    REPLACED, never passed through — a
//                                    caller cannot put an arbitrary string
//                                    into a column typed uuid, and cannot use
//                                    this header as a free-text injection
//                                    point into structured logs either.
//   withCorrelationHeader(res,id) — attach x-correlation-id to a Response
//                                    without disturbing its status or body.
//   wrapWithCorrelation(handler)  — the one middleware. Wraps a Worker
//                                    fetch(request, env, ctx) handler:
//                                      1. resolves the correlation id,
//                                      2. sets env.CORRELATION_ID so it is
//                                         available to a record-verb write or
//                                         a database operation downstream —
//                                         the SAME per-request env-mutation
//                                         pattern mcp.js's dispatch() already
//                                         uses for env.ctx (see that file's
//                                         `env.ctx = ctx;` line), not a new
//                                         convention,
//                                      3. calls the wrapped handler,
//                                      4. on a thrown error, logs one
//                                         structured line carrying the id and
//                                         returns a 500 whose JSON body also
//                                         carries it — "attached to error
//                                         output" cannot mean only a header,
//                                      5. echoes the id back as
//                                         x-correlation-id on every response,
//                                         success or error, always.
//
// WHERE THIS IS WIRED: index.js's top-level default export, once —
// `fetch: wrapWithCorrelation(routeRequest)` — so every route (the OAuth
// doors, /health, /release, /ingest, /mcp under every one of the four auth
// doors, /pipeline/changes, the Deal Room web handler, /capture) is covered
// without any individual route body being touched. See index.js's own
// comment at that line for why one wrap point is correct here.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not write to
// ops.run, ops.deployment, ops.incident, or ops.work_request. Checked by
// reading tools.js, mcp.js, dealroom.js, dealroom-web.js and capture.js in
// full: this Worker writes to none of those tables today (zero hits for
// "ops.run", "ops.deployment", "ops.incident", "ops.work_request" anywhere
// under mcp-server/src/), so there is no existing write to thread a
// correlation id into. env.CORRELATION_ID is the hook the first such write
// will read from — deliberately not exercised here, because inventing a
// write path this build was not asked to build would be scope creep, not
// closing the gap.
