// WR-000111 — the durable half of the V5 hierarchical cost ledger.
//
// LIBRARY ONLY, and the phrasing here is deliberate: this file carries no
// shebang and none of the three JavaScript main-module constructs the SCAC
// inventory scans for. It scans by SUBSTRING, so naming those constructs in a
// comment is itself enough to register the file as a new sealed script
// entrypoint and move the inventoried frontier. Describe them, never spell them.
//
// TWO ROLES, AND THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
//   - The DATABASE is the serialization point. ops.lock_cost_ledger_cell holds
//     the cell row for the caller's whole transaction, which is exactly what
//     hierarchical-cost-ledger.v5.js says a durable store must supply.
//   - The MODULE is the rederiver. The transition is JavaScript over a frozen
//     operation registry and cannot be re-implemented in PL/pgSQL without
//     forking the thing this work exists to preserve. So commitLedgerOperation
//     below loads under the lock, REBUILDS the ledger value, proves the rebuild
//     hashes to the stored digest, and lets openLedgerCell rederive the
//     transition from its own held value. What reaches the database is what the
//     module produced, never a value a caller supplied.
