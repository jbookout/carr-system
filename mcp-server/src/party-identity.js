// CORRECT-PARTY-IDENTITY (Joe, 2026-10-08, about contact enrichment: "dont
// propose corrections, just make them"; rule 578fdd91). update-party-contact
// writes contact facts and refuses identity on purpose. This is the identity
// door: a party's name, its firm (org) and its state, from a verified finding.
//
// Three properties carry the rule's trade-off (an occasional wrong edit that is
// cheap to undo, over a pile of proposals nobody applies):
//   - confirmed high/medium identity evidence, independent corroboration and a
//     re-verifiable source are required before entering the write envelope;
//     every changed field records its evidence and prior value for reversal;
//   - base_version guards the party exactly as update-party-contact does;
//   - an org change follows rule 8cddc6ad. A shared org row is never renamed,
//     because renaming it would re-label every other record on it. "Shared" is
//     counted by the database across EVERY foreign key into party
//     (party_reference_counts, migration 0852), not only party.org_id: a deal
//     participant, a client or vendor row, or a party link on the org row makes
//     it shared too. Only the target is re-pointed, and the other people on the
//     old org are read back afterwards; if any moved, the call refuses and the
//     transaction rolls back.
//
// Organisation identity is the database's org_identity_key(), the same key the
// unique index party_org_identity_uniq enforces; minting goes through
// org_party_id(), the shared find-or-create (rule a8c55a47: one job, one code
// path). Neither is re-implemented here.
