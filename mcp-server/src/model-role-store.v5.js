// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F04: the DURABLE half of Q106's role descriptions.
//
// model-routing.v5.js can DEFINE a role — validate a job description, seal it
// with `role_digest`, and prove that no occupant field participates in that
// seal. It cannot STORE one. It says so itself, under
// `v5ModelRoutingProjection().unimplemented_dependencies`: "durable
// qualification and decision record store: this slice adds no table, no
// migration and no SQL integration". This file is the missing durable half for
// the ROLE alone: versioned immutable revisions, an append-only history, and an
// explicit current pointer moved only by a compare-and-swap under S01's
// retained system authority.
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND ROLE CONTRACT, AND NOT A SECOND DIGEST SCHEME.
// `defineRole` is imported and called; the field list, the six role keys, the
// occupiable authority classes, the quality-floor rule, the reference grammar
// and the seal are all its. Nothing here re-decides what a role IS. There is
// exactly one hash over a role in this system — `digest(content)` as
// `defineRole` computes it — and both this module and ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql
// recompute THAT value from the persisted rows. No domain tag is wrapped around
// it here, because wrapping one would be a second digest scheme wearing the
// first one's name.
//
// A DURABLE ROLE CONFERS NOTHING. Storing a job description durably does not
// make it an authority, an occupancy, a route, a qualification or a numeric
// policy default. Every write result below carries `grants_authority: false`,
// `binds_occupant: false` and `measured_qualification_bound: false` as fields
// rather than as prose, and there is no argument, column or code path through
// which an occupant, a grant or a floor number could arrive. A role DECLARES an
// authority class; whether an actor may act is still S01's
// `evaluateActorAuthority` question, asked of a live actor at a live instant.
//
// THE ONE ACT THAT NEEDS AUTHORITY IS THE CURRENT POINTER, AND IT IS JOE'S.
// Recording a revision is inert: it appends a description nobody has selected.
// Naming WHICH revision is current is a system-design act, so it is evaluated
// through S01's own `evaluateActorAuthority` under the `system.design` action —
// authority class `system_authority`, which S01 reserves to the system-authority
// partner and makes non-delegable. This module does not restate that rule, does
// not weaken it, and accepts no `actor`, `approved`, `verified`, `principal` or
// `occupant` field from any payload: `assertNoSelfAssertedAuthority` refuses
// those by NAME at every depth, before the closed schemas even run.
//
// THE PRINCIPAL IS DERIVED THREE TIMES, FROM THREE SERVER-HELD FACTS, AND NONE
// OF THEM IS A CALLER'S WORD.
//   1. IN THIS PROCESS, from the live actor object the server built, through
//      S01's evaluateActorAuthority under `system.design`.
//   2. IN THE DATABASE, THE AUTHORITY LOGIN SCOPE, from
//      `ops.authority_actor_slug()`, which reads `session_user` on the
//      per-partner authority connection and admits nothing else — the same
//      derivation migration 0161's `ops.disable_legacy_schedule` already uses.
//   3. IN THE DATABASE, WHO ACTUALLY ACTED, from
//      `ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id()` (migration 0496) on the SAME
//      TRANSACTION, which resolves `carr.acting_actor_slug` and, for a human
//      actor, additionally requires `carr.verified_human_actor_slug` to name the
//      same slug.
// THE SECOND AND THIRD ARE DIFFERENT FACTS, AND CONFLATING THEM WOULD BE A LIE.
// partner-authority.js deliberately routes the sponsored agents `codex`,
// `claude`, `joe-local` and `dell-local` onto the partner's own authority login,
// so `ops.authority_actor_slug()` answers `'joe'` for an act a sponsored agent
// performed. Naming which revision of a role description is current is
// non-delegable and Joe's, so the record layer refuses unless the acting
// principal is Joe's own active human actor, and records the two separately —
// `set_by_partner_slug` for the login scope, `set_by_acting_actor_slug` for who
// acted. This verb compares the acting principal against the actor it evaluated
// on the way back out.
//   WHAT IS STILL NOT PROVED, said exactly rather than implied: the acting-actor
//   context is a TRANSACTION-LOCAL SETTING the server establishes with
//   mcp.js's setWriterActorContext. A session that holds the
//   `carr_authority_joe` login DIRECTLY — psql, or any code path that opens that
//   connection without going through mcp.js — can call
//   `set_config('carr.acting_actor_slug','joe',true)` and
//   `set_config('carr.verified_human_actor_slug','joe',true)` itself, because
//   neither is privileged state. So what the database enforces is a TRUSTED
//   RUNTIME CONTEXT, not an authenticated identity: it closes the flattening of
//   every sponsored agent's act to "Joe did it" on the runtime path, and it does
//   NOT turn possession of the authority login into proof of a human. An
//   authenticated-receipt-identity binding would, and this repository mints
//   none; this slice invents no substitute. See
//   MODEL_ROLE_PRINCIPAL_BINDING_SCOPE, which carries the claim and its limit on
//   every result rather than leaving a reader to assume the stronger one.
//
// WHAT THE DATABASE RECHECKS, because a JS caller's assertion is not evidence.
// The candidate SQL rebuilds the whole role preimage FROM THE STORED ROWS,
// recomputes the digest over those bytes, re-derives the writer and the partner
// principal, and refuses on any drift — before a revision is returned and again
// before a current pointer is inserted. A digest a caller supplies is only ever
// COMPARED against one the rows produce. No current role is hardcoded anywhere:
// there is no seed, no fixture role and no default revision in this file or in
// the candidate SQL, and a role nobody has recorded reads back as absent.
//
// READS RECONSTRUCT AND REVALIDATE. Every revision the record layer returns is
// rebuilt HERE through `defineRole` and re-hashed, so a read is a statement
// about bytes this process independently re-derived rather than a column the
// database happened to hold. The authenticity that buys is stated precisely in
// MODEL_ROLE_AUTHENTICITY_SCOPE: it is re-derivation from committed rows, and
// it is NOT a signature, NOT a capability token, and NOT the routing kernel's
// process-local WeakSet provenance — model-routing.v5.js already says those
// brands cannot survive a database row, and storing a role does not change it.
//
// A READ THAT CANNOT REVALIDATE FAILS CLOSED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN, NOT A BUG.
// If any revision in a role's history does not rebuild, the read REFUSES rather
// than skipping that revision, repairing it, or returning a partial history: a
// history with a hole silently removed is not the history, and this rail has no
// delete path, no update path and no repair verb by construction. The refusal
// names the role, the revision number and the contract version the row was
// stored under, so the finding is actionable without a rewrite.
//   THE DRIFT CASE, SCOPED RATHER THAN LEFT OPEN: a future tightening of the
//   role contract is a VERSIONED-READER problem. Every stored revision carries
//   the `role_schema_version` it was written under, the candidate SQL pins that
//   column to `role-description.v1` with a CHECK, and this module refuses any
//   entry naming a version it cannot revalidate. A `role-description.v2` is then
//   answered by a reader that revalidates each revision under ITS OWN version —
//   never by mutating stored v1 rows to satisfy a contract they were not written
//   under, which would destroy the only thing those rows are evidence of. See
//   MODEL_ROLE_READ_COMPATIBILITY_SCOPE.
//
// NAMED, NOT FILLED. This slice adds no qualification producer, no dispatch and
// no backend health source. Those gaps belong to the routing kernel's own
// projection and are re-exported below from it rather than restated, so there
// is one list and it stays one list.
//
// NOT REGISTERED. `modelRoleStoreTools` is exported and is deliberately added
// to no tool index by this slice: registering a verb — and especially an
// `authorityOnly` one — is a separate, reviewed act. Applying
// ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql as a numbered migration is another.
//
// NO `humanOnly` LABEL IS DECLARED, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE ACCURATE STATEMENT.
// Joe's 2026-08-26 ruling (decision dc57f62d) retired the `humanOnly` refusal:
// mcp.js's callTool no longer reads it, and the only live consumer is
// mutation-registry.js's `human_only: tool?.humanOnly === true`, which is
// compared against the registered contract. Declaring it here would therefore
// protect nothing and would MISREPORT this verb's protection the moment it is
// registered. `authorityOnly` is the live gate (mcp.js routes the verb onto the
// per-partner authority DSN and refuses without one), and the human requirement
// is carried by the two places that actually enforce it: S01's evaluation here,
// which requires `actor.human === true` and the system-authority partner, and
// the candidate SQL's acting-principal binding, which requires the transaction's
// acting actor to be that partner's own active human actor.
