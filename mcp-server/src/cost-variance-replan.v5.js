// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A04: ESTIMATE VARIANCE, THE 150/200 THRESHOLDS, AND
// WHAT A REPLAN IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE (decisions Q115.D1, Q128.D1).
//
// THE TWO SETTLED SENTENCES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE:
//
//   Q115.D1 — "Measure total builder, retry, review, adjudication, and rework
//   cost; major estimate error triggers automated review and replan but never
//   unqualified routing or weakened quality."
//
//   Q128.D1 — "Warn at 150 percent expected cost, automatically replan at 200
//   percent or qualification failure, continue only when value and quality
//   remain justified, and involve Joe only for envelope, critical-path, or
//   quality changes."
//
// WHY THE NUMBERS ARE CONSTANTS HERE AND POLICY INPUTS NEXT DOOR. V5-F04's
// routing kernel holds no number of its own because every number it uses is a
// business judgement that a policy author owns. 150 and 200 are not that: they
// are the settled decision's own text, and a caller who could pass 300 instead
// would be overriding Q128 rather than configuring this module. So they are
// exported constants, spelled in basis points, with the decision id on the
// line. Changing one means changing the decision.
//
// WHAT "COST" MEANS IN THE NUMERATOR, and it is the clause most easily got
// wrong. The comparison is INCURRED against EXPECTED. Incurred is actuals plus
// liabilities still owed — money that is really gone. It is NOT commitments:
// an outstanding reservation is an intention and can still be cancelled, and
// counting one as a 200-percent overrun would replan a slice that had not yet
// spent anything. The ledger's projection already separates the two and this
// module reads `incurred_units`, never `committed_units`.
//
// THE THING A REPLAN MAY NEVER DO. Q115 is explicit that a major estimate error
// "never" buys unqualified routing or weakened quality, so the replan directive
// this module returns carries `permits_unqualified_routing: false` and
// `permits_quality_downgrade: false` as CONSTANTS on every answer, and the four
// levers it may pull are a closed list that contains no cheaper-but-unqualified
// option. There is no input — no threshold, no justification, no escalation —
// that produces a fifth lever or flips either flag. That is tested by sweeping
// every combination the closed vocabularies admit, not by spot checks.
//
// "INVOLVE JOE ONLY FOR..." IS READ AS THE HUMAN PARTNER, NOT AS JOE'S NAME.
// Rule b42e217e forbids scoping capability by WHICH partner holds it — Dell is
// a full writer and teacher, equal to Joe — so Q128's escalation is implemented
// as "escalate to a human partner", with the partner slug validated against
// identity.js's `isKnownPartner` rather than compared to a literal. The
// RESTRICTIVE half of the clause, which is the half that does work, is
// unchanged and enforced exactly: only an envelope, critical-path or quality
// change escalates, and every other change kind is handled without a human.
//
// A SHORTFALL IS AN ANSWER; A MALFORMED INPUT IS A THROW, as everywhere else in
// this slice. "No estimate was ever recorded, so there is no denominator" is a
// fact about the ledger and is RETURNED as `unavailable`. "This change kind is
// not registered" is a contract violation and THROWS.
//
// NO EFFECTS. No filesystem, no network, no database, no environment and no
// clock. This module does not open the incident it says is required, because
// opening one is the record layer's authority-bound verb and no pure module can
// reach it; the projection says so rather than imitating it.

// Firing: a warning or a replan is an EVENT at a crossing, not a state.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `evaluateReplan` answers "where is this node now?" and has no memory, so a
// caller who asks it twice is told "warn" twice. Q128 says to WARN at 150 and
// REPLAN at 200, which happens once when the line is crossed rather than on
// every read. So a signal FIRES when, and only when, one committed operation
// moves a node's band UPWARD across a threshold.
//
// WHY THIS IS IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a dedupe table:
//   - a crossing is computed from two ADJACENT ledger values, the one before an
//     operation and the one after it, and each operation produces exactly one
//     version, so each crossing belongs to exactly one version;
//   - a replay, a refusal and a race loser all leave the incurred totals
//     unchanged, so their before and after bands are equal and nothing fires;
//   - a signal id is `budget-signal:<tree>:<node>:<kind>:v<version>`, so two
//     readers of the same commit derive the same id and a persisting caller can
//     keep the first and drop the rest;
//   - staying above a threshold fires nothing. Falling back below it and then
//     crossing again is a NEW crossing at a NEW version and fires again with a
//     distinct id. That is the definition of "once per crossing", not a lapse.
//
// A jump from under 150 straight to 200 or more crosses BOTH lines in one
// operation and fires both, warning and replan, each once: both thresholds were
// crossed, and a reader counting warnings must not find one missing because the
// replan happened in the same step.
//
// A qualification failure fires a replan on the TRANSITION from qualified to
// qualification_failed. Staying failed fires nothing; recovering and failing
// again fires again. This module holds no qualification record of its own (see
// the projection), so the caller supplies both sides of the transition.
