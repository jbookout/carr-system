// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02 — THE GATE ZERO PRODUCER, Step A.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS, in one sentence: the seam the three ruled evidence readers
// were built for. They answer truthfully about whatever row they are pointed at;
// pointing them is this module's job, and nothing else in this repository has
// ever been allowed to do it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, in the order it does it:
//
//   1. AIMS the three bound readers at NAMED rows, from bindings that are
//      module-private constants or derived from the staffed seat.
//   2. APPLIES the three deterministic clauses V5-A02's checkable_done names —
//      in production form, over READINGS, with the conditional mood gone.
//   3. EARNS `negative_admission_result` rather than writing it, by mutating a
//      reading in each required way and requiring its own clause to refuse.
//   4. ASSEMBLES one `consumer-gate-receipt.v1` — all twenty-one fields — and
//      takes its digest.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT, and every one of these is a door somebody could have built:
//
//   * IT TAKES NO ARGUMENT. `v5A02GateZeroEmitOutcome` has arity zero. There is
//     no evidence parameter, no hash parameter, no identity parameter, no head
//     revision parameter and no reader parameter. The PR 985 defect was a public
//     function that turned a CALLER'S DESCRIPTION of evidence into a verdict;
//     the standing rule of 2026-09-11 closes it under any name, and the cheapest
//     way to stay closed is to have nowhere to put one.
//   * IT READS NO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. Not for a binding, not for an identity,
//     not for a switch. The ONE thing the environment supplies is where a ruled
//     store lives, and that is `gate-zero-seam-stores.v5.js`'s business, reached
//     only through a reader whose ruling already said it may look.
//   * IT EXPORTS NO SETTER AND NO REGISTRY. Every binding below is either a
//     frozen module-private constant or DERIVED at call time from the candidate
//     tree, the ruled stores and the authenticated call. There is no line a
//     human pastes, so there is no human step inside this slice at all.
//   * IT WRITES NOTHING. No database, no file, no verb. Step A emits a VALUE.
//     Recording that value as a row is Step B, it is the heavy path, and it is
//     waiting on Joe's ruling about which authority may write it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RUN BINDING, AND WHY NOBODY PASTES IT.
//
// The addresses a Gate Zero run stands on are facts about THAT RUN: the
// candidate's head revision, the scheduler service and the canary the wrapper
// dispatched, the actor that built the candidate, and each Work-Request
// predecessor's acceptance receipt. None of them can be a caller argument, and
// none of them can be invented here — an invented hash is the exact "digest
// derived from a synthetic test fixture" that benchmark-acceptance-store.v5.js
// lists as explicitly refused.
//
// THE FIRST DRAFT SHIPPED THEM AS PASTED LINES, on the theory that a human
// editing a constant is how a ruling changes. The review was right to refuse it:
// the seam study says in its own words that there is NO human step in the middle
// of this slice, and a file whose comment says "somebody edits this and commits
// it" names no owner and never acquires one.
//
// SO EVERY ONE OF THEM IS DERIVED, and the table beside SCHEDULER_SERVICE_KEY
// below says from what.
//
// AND AN ABSENCE IS CLASSIFIED HONESTLY, which the second review round asked
// for. Two different things can go missing and they are two different answers:
// `gate_zero_candidate_metadata_absent` when this DEPLOY carries no usable build
// stamp — which var, which field — and `gate_zero_run_binding_unnamed` only when
// a RULED ROW is genuinely absent, which today is exactly one row: the
// release-candidate record naming who built the stamped revision. The first
// draft answered the second for everything, which described the wrong fault to
// whoever read it next.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE DIGEST RECIPE, AND THE ONE GAP THE SEAM STUDY NAMED.
//
// r7's canonicalization contract is JCS over UTF-8, SHA-256, no trailing
// newline, and its receipt-payload rule names domain tags for
// `benchmark-manifest.v1`, `attended-effect-capability.v1`,
// `attended-effect-consumption-receipt.v2` and
// `attended-effect-outcome-receipt.v1` — AND NOT FOR `consumer-gate-receipt.v1`.
// Two readings are available and they produce different digests: a plain
// `digest(receipt)`, or a tagged `digest([schema_version, receipt])`.
//
// THIS MODULE FOLLOWS THE REPOSITORY'S OWN PRECEDENT — plain `digest(receipt)`,
// JCS SHA-256 over the receipt object with no domain tag, which is what
// `benchmark-minimum.v5.js:1597` already does for a consumer-gate receipt it
// proposes. The choice is STATED rather than buried, as
// `V5_A02_GATE_ZERO_RECEIPT_DIGEST_RECIPE`, so a reviewer can overturn it in one
// line. If a reviewer prefers the tagged reading it becomes an r7 amendment, and
// an r7 amendment reseals all sixty-two chunks — which is precisely why the
// choice is on the surface instead of inside a function.
//
// And the rule's closing clause is obeyed either way: no artifact includes its
// own whole-byte digest as input to that digest. The receipt carries
// twenty-one fields and the digest is taken over all twenty-one; the digest is
// not one of them.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHO SIGNS, AND IT IS NOT A CONSTANT.
//
// r7's identity rule: all identities derive from authenticated execution
// context, `producer_role` binds to the registry entry, and the subject maker's
// actor and session must differ from the evaluator's. Caller-supplied identity,
// unauthorized role, or same-actor self-review denies.
//
// THE FIRST DRAFT RECONSTRUCTED THEM instead. It read card 9's holder ref, took
// the actor slug out of it, and built each session ref out of that slug plus a
// digest of the evidence — so any process that imported this module got a
// receipt signed `codex-reviewer` without authenticating anything, and two runs
// over the same rows shared a session. That is the defect the review named
// first, and it is closed here rather than patched.
//
// THE PRODUCER AND THE EVALUATOR ARE THE AUTHENTICATED CALLER, read through the
// module-private `authenticatedCaller()` below. There is no exported reader and
// no exported setter anywhere on this path: the value it answers with is the one
// identity.js's SINGLE REQUEST ENTRY established, derived there from a bearer
// that file matched against the credential map it read from the server's own
// environment. The second round found `runInAuthenticatedCall(actor, fn)` shipped
// as a public export taking an ordinary object; the fifth found the pair that
// replaced it — a public minter and a public dispatcher-factory — composed by a
// probe into the same thing. Neither name exists now, and nothing exported by
// that file returns a branded actor or a callable that enters a context.
//
// THE SUBJECT MAKER IS THE RELEASE-CANDIDATE RECORD FOR THE STAMPED REVISION
// (amendment 9(b), 2026-09-14) — the ops.release row `tools/ops-record.py
// release candidate` filed over an authenticated authority connection for this
// exact build, read back through the Control Plane store. Both halves come out
// of that row: the maker it names, resolved through identity.js's partner
// registry, and the correlation the recorder stamped on it as the session. It is
// NOT HEAD's committer any more, which the third round installed and the fifth
// round's finding 3 undid: a committer line is an attribution anybody with a git
// config can write, the deployed Worker cannot read one, and the session beside
// it was being manufactured by suffixing the EVALUATOR'S OWN session with
// `:candidate-build` — the reviewer's seat, relabelled as the maker's.
//
// CARD 9 IS STILL WHAT BINDS THE SEAM. An unstaffed seat still turns the whole
// slice dark. What the seat no longer does is sign: naming who may sign and
// being the signer are different acts.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO KINDS OF NO, inherited unchanged from global-boundaries.v5.js:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER IS RETURNED, with a stable `reason_id` out of the closed
//     registry below.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION THROWS V5BoundaryError. Handing this module an
//     argument is not a policy question.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE IDENTITIES, DERIVED FROM THE AUTHENTICATED CALL.
//
// r7's identity rule: the gateway derives all identities from authenticated
// execution context, binds `producer_role` to the registry entry, and requires
// the subject maker's actor and session to differ from the evaluator's.
//
// THE FIRST REVIEW ROUND FOUND THIS FILE RECONSTRUCTING THEM. It read card 9's
// holder ref, took the actor slug out of it, and manufactured a session ref from
// that slug and a digest of what it had just read — so any process that imported
// this module received a receipt signed `codex-reviewer` without authenticating
// anything, and two runs over the same evidence shared a "session".
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOW. The module-private `authenticatedCaller()` below answers
// with the identity tools.js's verb dispatch bound to the async context for THIS
// call — actor, session and authority class, each derived in identity.js from an
// actor that file minted from a credential, with the session ref being
// correlation.js's per-request correlation id. Outside an authenticated call it
// answers null and this producer refuses; inside one established from a
// FABRICATED actor object it also answers null, because identity.js will not
// derive an identity for an object it did not mint. A test, a CLI probe and an
// unauthenticated import all take that path, which is the point: nothing that
// cannot authenticate can obtain a receipt.
//
// CARD 9 IS STILL LOAD-BEARING and is unchanged by this: the seat declaration is
// what BINDS the producer seam at all, so an unstaffed seat still turns the whole
// slice dark. What the seat no longer does is supply an identity. Naming who may
// sign and being the signer are different acts, which is the distinction the
// first round collapsed.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// AMENDMENT 2'S CLOSED SHAPE FOR AN EXPORTED CALLABLE comes from
// ./closed-callable.js, which is the ONE definition this module and identity.js
// now share. It used to be copied into both: the bodies still matched, but the
// clauses each copy documented had drifted, and a duplicated security primitive
// drifts in behaviour immediately after it drifts in prose. The Gate Zero seam
// modules keep their own local copies on purpose — each of those is held to
// being self-contained and one asserts by source that it holds exactly one
// definition — so the unification is exactly the two copies that were free to
// diverge.

 * DECLARATION: a constant in a source file, authenticating nobody. The third
 * round replaced it with HEAD's own committer address through a frozen table —
 * better, and still not authentication: a committer line is an attribution
 * anybody with a git config can write, and the session half of the identity was
 * then MANUFACTURED, first here out of the revision and then one file over by
 * suffixing the evaluator's own session with `:candidate-build`. The fifth round
 * put it exactly: "this relabels the reviewer's authenticated session as the
 * subject-maker's build session; it is not authenticated provenance for the
 * person who made the candidate."
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOW. `tools/ops-record.py release candidate` files one row in
 * ops.release per build, over an authenticated authority connection, carrying
 * the revision, the maker and the correlation the recorder stamped. This reads
 * that row back for the revision the deploy wrapper stamped into this Worker —
 * so BOTH HALVES of the identity come out of a record somebody had to be
 * authenticated to write, and neither is assembled from the call that is doing
 * the judging.
 *
 * THE ROWS ARE READ, NOT TRUSTED. Exactly one maker may answer: rows for the
 * revision that disagree about who made it are an ambiguous record and refuse,
 * because a receipt that picked one of two makers would be picking. The slug
 * must then be one identity.js REGISTERS as a partner — the store already
 * refuses anything that is not slug-shaped, and this refuses anything the
 * partner registry does not know — so the widest value this path can put in a
 * receipt is a registered partner's name.

 * has neither. The wrapper's sealer reads ids and contents from the object store
 * at one revision, so there is no second reading to disagree, and the question
 * the old comparison asked — is this checkout what it claims to be — is answered
 * where it belongs: bin/deploy-worker.sh refuses a dirty tree before it uploads.
 *
 * ONE BYTE STILL MOVES THIS DIGEST. Change a candidate file, and its blob id and
 * its content hash both move, so the sealed manifest moves, so the stamp moves,
 * so this moves. mcp-server/test/gate-zero-candidate-seal.test.mjs proves that
 * over a real repository rather than asserting it here.
