// release.js — builds the /release payload: what code this Worker is
// actually running, so a verification pass never has to guess (Phase 1,
// 2026-08-13, closing the deploy-provenance gap named in the Phase 0 audit).
//
// WHY A SEPARATE FILE. index.js imports OAuthProvider from
// @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider, which pulls in `cloudflare:` runtime
// modules — that file cannot be loaded outside the Worker runtime, so
// nothing implemented there is provable before a deploy (see index.js's
// "local token" comment, same reasoning identity.js was split out for).
// This module holds no cloudflare: import and no OAuth machinery, so
// node --test can exercise the actual payload-building logic with a fake
// env and a fake `sql` tag function — no live database, no deploy required.
//
// SIX FIELDS, EACH HONEST ON ITS OWN:
//   verb_count          — Object.keys(TOOLS).length, computed from the code
//                          bundled INTO THIS DEPLOY. Never a written marker
//                          (mcp-server/.last-deployed-verb-count is exactly
//                          that, and going stale is the gap this endpoint
//                          closes) — this number cannot lie about what
//                          shipped because it is read from the shipped code.
//   git_sha              — the ONE field with no runtime source: a Worker
//                          cannot read git at request time. Stamped in at
//                          deploy time as env.GIT_SHA (bin/deploy-worker.sh:
//                          `wrangler deploy --var GIT_SHA:<sha>`). Missing
//                          means a deploy happened OUTSIDE that script —
//                          reported as null + a reason, never guessed or
//                          left silently absent.
//   provider / worker_version — Cloudflare's runtime version-metadata binding,
//                          not a source digest or a value supplied by the
//                          deploy wrapper. `id` is the immutable Worker version
//                          identity that Cloudflare is actually serving; `tag`
//                          and `timestamp` are provider metadata. Local dev or
//                          an older deployment can lack the binding, in which
//                          case the entire identity is visibly unknown.
//   schema                — schema_migrations is tools/migrate.py's ledger
//                          of applied migrations. Read through v_schema_ledger
//                          (0113), a two-column view over schema_migrations,
//                          because carr_reader — the role this endpoint's
//                          DATABASE_URL_READER connection uses — is a
//                          views-only role by design (0004); the endpoint's
//                          first live call found that gap (permission denied
//                          on schema_migrations direct) and 0113 closed it
//                          with a view rather than a base-table grant, to
//                          keep that posture intact. It is NOT ground truth
//                          either way: tools/ledger-repair.py exists because
//                          this exact table drifted from reality once already
//                          (four migrations physically applied to production
//                          outside the runner were invisible to it until
//                          repaired 2026-07-31). So this field reports what
//                          the TRACKING TABLE CLAIMS, and says so in its own
//                          `note`, every time.
//   doctrine_generation   — same query doctrine.js's standing-context verb
//                          already runs (`select generation from
//                          doctrine_meta where id = 1`), reused rather than
//                          reinvented.
//   program6_actions      — exact public posture of the reviewed browser
//                          mutation flag. It is derived by the same parser as
//                          the Deal Room gate and never echoes arbitrary env.
//
// A field that cannot be read returns { value: null, reason: "<why>" } (or
// the schema-shaped equivalent) — never omitted, never a guess. A stale or
// absent value must be visibly absent, per the honesty requirement this was
// built against.
