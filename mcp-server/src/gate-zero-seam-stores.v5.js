// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02, the seam half: THE THREE STORES, AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// This file fetches rows. It decides nothing. Every function here either returns
// the rows a store actually holds for one addressed query, or throws
// SeamStoreUnreachable naming what it could not reach. It contains no
// classification, no comparison, no threshold and no vocabulary a consumer could
// act on — those live as MODULE-PRIVATE functions inside
// gate-zero-seam-readers.v5.js, which is the only module that imports this one.
//
// WHY THE SPLIT IS THE POINT. The defect this slice exists to prevent is a
// function that turns a description of evidence into an outcome. A fetcher that
// also judges can be handed a fabricated connection and will judge it. So the
// I/O is here, exported and judgment-free; the judgment is private to the reader
// that fetched the rows, and is exported by nothing.
//
// NO CALLER EVER SUPPLIES A CONNECTION. There is no handle parameter, no client
// parameter, no `env` parameter and no injectable opener. The query arguments
// below ADDRESS a row — which work request, which service, which commit — and
// addressing is not asserting. A caller can say which row to look at; it can
// never say what is in it.
//
// WHERE THE CONNECTION COMES FROM, and why that is not the env override the
// ruling table forbids. The RULING is the switch: while a seam's decision id is
// null its reader never calls into this file at all. What the environment
// supplies is only WHERE the ruled store lives — the same read-only DSN and the
// same GitHub credentials every other ops-side reader in this repository uses.
// An absent DSN is not a fallback and not a degraded mode: it throws, the reader
// reports unreachable, and nothing optimistic is returned. WHICH REPOSITORY the
// checks store serves is NOT part of that: see AUTHORITATIVE_REPOSITORY below.
//
// THESE RUN OPS-SIDE, NOT IN THE WORKER. Gate Zero is a control-plane gate; its
// readers run in the ops/CI process, where `process.env` and a Postgres socket
// exist. `pg` is imported DYNAMICALLY inside the two database functions so the
// Worker bundle never pulls it in through this module's import graph.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TWO INVARIANTS THIS FILE OWES ITS CALLERS, both of them whole-file rules
// rather than a habit applied where somebody remembered.
//
// (1) NO STORE TEXT REACHES A CALLER. Every value in every row this file returns
//     is one of exactly three things: a CONSTANT written in this file, a value
//     that MATCHED A TOTAL PATTERN owned by this file, or a DIGEST of store
//     text. Nothing else travels. A row read out of Postgres or off the GitHub
//     wire is text nobody here controls — a service key, a check name, an
//     evidence ref, a status word — and a reader that put it in an answer would
//     be handing a consumer a word the store chose. Equality still works, which
//     is all any derivation asks of these fields: two digests are equal exactly
//     when the two strings were.
//
// (2) NOTHING BUT A REGISTERED REFUSAL LEAVES AN EXPORT. Every exported callable
//     here is wrapped by `guarded`, one boundary, applied in one place. Whatever
//     is thrown underneath it — a native TypeError with the CALLER'S frames in
//     its stack, `throw "allow"`, `throw true`, a Proxy whose traps throw — is
//     caught and replaced by a SeamStoreUnreachable carrying a registered store
//     token and a registered reason, whose own fields are non-writable data
//     properties and whose `stack` is a fixed string this file wrote. A caller
//     function named `green` therefore never appears anywhere in what comes
//     back out, because no engine-produced stack ever does.

/**
 * THE TWO CLOSED REGISTRIES, AND WHY NEITHER IS EXPORTED.
 *
 * A reader puts this error's `because` straight into its answer, so every byte
 * of it has to be a byte this file wrote. An upstream driver message is text
 * nobody here controls — it can carry a fragment of a DSN, a host name, or a
 * word the privileged-word sweep closes over. A CALLER'S argument is worse:
 * this class is exported, so anything can construct it with anything.
 *
 * So the constructor is a FILTER, not a formatter. `storeRef` and `because` are
 * looked up in the frozen registries below BY IDENTITY, and the error carries
 * the registered value that matched — never the argument. An unregistered
 * argument is not quoted back in a complaint about itself, which is the escape
 * the ninth review round found: it is replaced by the registered unknown-store
 * token and the registered not-a-registered-reason phrase, so the refusal is
 * still a refusal and still says nothing the caller wrote.
 *
 * Neither registry is exported. A consumer that wants to know what this file
 * can say reads this file; an importer that could enumerate the set could
 * assemble a message out of it and hand it back in.

 *
 * THE PROXY THAT USED TO BE HERE IS DELETED, not tightened. A proxy forwards

 *
 * TIMESTAMPS ARE THE WHOLE POINT of this query, so the three the clauses need
 * are selected and none is computed here: `started_at` is dispatch, `ended_at`
 * and `observed_at` are readback. Ordering by `observed_at desc` is a
 * presentation choice; the reader compares instants and never trusts position.
 *
 * THE IDENTIFIERS COME BACK AS DIGESTS. A service key, a run key, an evidence
 * ref, a source kind and a source ref are all free-form ledger text,
 * and the derivation asks nothing of them but equality — is this observation of
 * the same run as that dispatch, was this row written by the wrapper. Digesting
 * answers exactly those questions and answers nothing else, so a service someone
 * names `release-canary` cannot put a privileged word into an answer. The two
 * receipt fields are digested for the same reason and answer the same kind of
 * question: `receipt_run_key_digest` is what the receipt says its run is,
 * `run_key_receipt_digest` is what this row's own run key hashes to, and
 * `receipt_minted_at` is the instant the wrapper stamped after its child exited.
