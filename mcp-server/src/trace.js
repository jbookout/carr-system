// trace.js — Program 4, Gap A2 (defect cae5be2e-267c-40ba-9424-b4618845e905,
// 2026-08-14). correlation.js mints and echoes an x-correlation-id on every
// route and sets env.CORRELATION_ID, but nothing wrote it anywhere a failed
// request could later be found by it. An outage drill proved the gap live:
// an unauthenticated /mcp call to staging returned a truthful 401 carrying the
// id, and ops.v_trace on staging had nothing for it. See migrations/
// 0122_worker_trace.sql for the schema half of this fix (tool_call.correlation_id
// and event.correlation_id — the MATERIAL WRITE half, wired in mcp.js's
// dispatch() and tools.js's auditIdentity()/withEnvelope()/writeEvent()) and
// that migration's header for why FAILURES land in ops.incident rather than a
// new ops.run row per request.
//
// LIKE correlation.js, THE CLASSIFIER HALF OF THIS FILE IS DB-FREE AND PURE —
// httpFailureClass, rpcInternalErrorFailureClass, and incidentSignature take
// no client, no env, no cloudflare: import, so node --test exercises them
// directly. recordWorkerFailure touches a database only through an injected
// `query` function (text, params) => Promise<{rows}>, the exact convention
// mcp.js's readCallInsertSQL/recordReadCall already use — so ITS logic is also
// unit-testable with a fake. THE ONE REMAINING SEAM, wrapNeonRows, is the
// adapter between that internal {rows} contract and what neon(dsn).query()
// ACTUALLY returns (a bare array — see its own comment for the production
// incident this caused), and it is exported and unit-tested on its own for
// exactly that reason: it is the one place a correct-looking internal contract
// met a real driver and disagreed, silently, in production.
//
// ── THE INCLUSION RULE, STATED ONCE, DEFENDED HERE ─────────────────────────
// Record exactly two things a failed request can be. Never a row per request —
// see the migration header for why that would flood ops.run specifically, and
// the same "signal, not traffic" reasoning applies here to ops.incident too:
// a hot loop of undifferentiated rows is what 0116's signature/dedup exists to
// prevent, and this recorder leans on that mechanism rather than writing
// around it.
//
//   1. httpFailureClass(status) — any HTTP response the Worker itself returns
//      with status >= 500. This covers /health, /ingest and /pipeline/changes'
//      explicit 503s (database unreachable) and the top-level 500 correlation.js's
//      own wrapWithCorrelation produces for an uncaught throw anywhere in the
//      stack. These are unambiguous: the Worker is telling a caller it failed.
//
//   2. rpcInternalErrorFailureClass(code, context) — the /mcp JSON-RPC transport's own
//      "internal error" envelope, code -32603. THIS ROUTE NEEDS ITS OWN RULE
//      because it deliberately returns HTTP 200 for a JSON-RPC-level error (the
//      MCP spec's isError-in-body convention — see mcp.js's `reply`/`rpcError`,
//      neither of which ever passes a non-200 status). An uncaught exception
//      inside a tool call, a raw database error tools.js's pgConstraintError()
//      does not recognise, or any other unhandled throw during dispatch() all
//      surface as this ONE code, on this ONE route, at HTTP 200 — treating 200
//      as "nothing to record" would hide every one of them, which is exactly
//      the "unhandled throw / database error / verb fails mid-write" class the
//      brief names. Every OTHER JSON-RPC error code is a ToolError — a refusal
//      the system got right (not_in_profile, missing_idempotency_key,
//      version_conflict, key_reuse, actor_not_provisioned, invalid_field_value,
//      …) — and recording those would flood the ledger with the system doing
//      its job, not with the system malfunctioning. -32603 is the one code
//      considered for this route: dispatch() passes the verb and thrown error
//      so a narrow, verb-specific allowlist can exclude known raw
//      policy/admission raises while preserving unexpected exceptions and
//      runtime/database faults as incidents.
//
//   3. actorUnresolvedFailureClass — mcpApiHandler's and protectedApiHandler's
//      own `if (!actor) return json({error:"unauthorized"},401)` (index.js): a
//      request whose OAuth grant the provider ALREADY validated, decrypted,
//      and handed to our code as ctx.props — but whose props do not map to a
//      known actor. That is a real identity/config problem (a stale grant, an
//      actor row missing, code drift in identity.js), not a caller mistake.
//
// EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED, ON PURPOSE: any 401/403 the OAuthProvider library itself
// returns before either of the two routes above ever runs — "a routine 401 on
// an unauthenticated probe is noise" (the brief's own words, and the exact
// case the outage drill's own unauthenticated call produced). This code
// structurally cannot see WHY the library refused a request — no token, wrong
// token, and an expired grant are all indistinguishable from here — so nothing
// this file could record about them would be signal rather than a guess
// dressed as one. Also excluded: every ToolError (ordinary business-logic
// refusals returned at HTTP 200 with isError:true) and actor_not_provisioned
// specifically (a well-handled, well-messaged refusal with its own hint — not
// an unhandled anything).

// PR #148 shipped, migration 0122 applied clean, grants were correct
// (carr_writer already held select/insert/update on ops.incident/
// ops.incident_fact and select on ops.service — verified again below), and
// the recorder STILL never wrote a row. Root-caused live against production,
// not hypothesised:
//
//   1. Induced a real failure through the deployed Worker (probe token,
//      read-loop with a malformed uuid) — got back the exact -32603 envelope
//      this file's classifier targets, with a real x-correlation-id.
//   2. `tools/ops-record.py trace <that id>` answered "no trace". Direct read
//      of ops.incident on production: no new row at all, not even a failed
//      attempt visible anywhere — because nothing WAS visible anywhere; see
//      finding 2 below.
//   3. THE DECISIVE CHECK: tool_read_call — mcp.js's recordReadCall, a
//      DIFFERENT function, scheduled through the IDENTICAL ctx.waitUntil,
//      against the IDENTICAL env.DATABASE_URL_WRITER, via the IDENTICAL
//      neon() driver — recorded that EXACT probe request
//      (verb=read-loop, actor_slug=smoke-probe, ok=false,
//      error_kind=internal_error, at the same timestamp). That proves
//      ctx.waitUntil fires, DATABASE_URL_WRITER authenticates, and INSERT
//      succeeds through this exact pipeline — ruling out a missing grant
//      (candidate a) and an unreached waitUntil (candidate c) at once.
//   4. So the difference had to be THIS file's own code, not the wiring
//      around it. recordReadCall never reads anything off its insert's
//      result; every function in THIS file does (`svc.rows.length`,
//      `r.rows[0]?.id`, ...). @neondatabase/serverless's own documented
//      contract for `neon(dsn).query(text, params)`: "the query function
//      returns database rows directly" — e.g.
//      `await sql.query("SELECT ...", [...])  // -> [ { greeting: "..." } ]`,
//      a BARE ARRAY, never `{rows: [...]}` unless `fullResults: true` is
//      passed (it is not, here). scheduleFailureRecord's old `query` was
//      `(text, params) => neon(env.DATABASE_URL_WRITER).query(text, params)`
//      — the bare array, unwrapped. recordWorkerFailure's very FIRST query
//      (`select id from ops.service...`) returned that bare array, `svc.rows`
//      read `undefined`, `.length` threw a TypeError, and recordWorkerFailure's
//      own outer catch swallowed it — on every single call, with (before this
//      fix) no log line to say so either. THE SAME MISTAKE THIS FILE'S OWN
//      DESIGN NOTE WARNED ABOUT AVOIDING FOR TOOL_READ_CALL never touched this
//      new code, because it was never written through the one place that
//      already got the shape right: mcp.js's own read-branch client object,
//      `{ query: async (text, params) => ({ rows: await sql.query(text, params) }) }`.
//
// wrapNeonRows below is that same adapter, extracted and named so it is
// independently unit-testable — the unit test that WOULD have caught this
// (trace.test.mjs) mocked `query` returning `{rows:[...]}` directly, which
// is the shape THIS file's internals correctly expect, but is NOT the shape
// the real driver returns. The mock was internally consistent and wrong
