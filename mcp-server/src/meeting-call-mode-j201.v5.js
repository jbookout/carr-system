// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J201 — non-recording Meeting and Call Mode, as a pure
// deterministic kernel.
//
// Four settled decisions (Q059.D3, Q074.D1, Q088.D1, Q123.D2) are encoded here
// as ONE closed, versioned domain contract with a deterministic digest, plus
// pure evaluators over that contract. Canonicalization and hashing come from
// artifact-trust.js, the no-effects marker and the privacy boundary come from
// global-boundaries.v5.js, the record homes and evidence vocabulary come from
// record-source-authority.v5.js (V5-F01), and the partner predicate comes from
// identity.js. This file reimplements none of them.
//
// THE ONE SENTENCE THE WHOLE SLICE TURNS ON, from Q088.D1: DETECTION CREATES A
// PROMPT, NOT PERMISSION TO RECORD. Everything below is arranged so that no
// input, in any order, can turn an observation into a recording. `recording` is
// the literal string "denied" on every result this module can produce, success
// and refusal alike, and there is no field, flag, policy input or seam through
// which a caller can move it. The recording policy itself is TABLED, not
// decided; V5_J201_RECORDING_POLICY_SEAM names where a future decision would
// live, so a reader cannot mistake this refusal for a ruling and cannot mistake
// the absence of a ruling for a decision.
//
// WHAT IS CODE HERE AND WHAT MUST ARRIVE AS TYPED POLICY, because the line is
// the point of the slice:
//
//   IN CODE — the STRUCTURE the four decisions settle. That a calendar entry
//   alone never suffices; that an `unknown` signal never corroborates; that
//   reconciliation keys on native source identity and never on time overlap;
//   that a recycled native id refuses instead of merging; that activation is an
//   explicit human one-tap and nothing else; that models may only speak after
//   activation and only into declared seams. These are identity, not knobs.
//
//   AS TYPED POLICY INPUT — the detection WINDOW and the corroboration COUNT.
//   How many seconds before a calendar start a meeting may be observed, how many
//   after its end, and how many corroborating signals a deployment demands. This
//   module invents none of them and ships no default for any of them; a missing
//   or malformed detection policy refuses. ONE FLOOR IS STRUCTURE RATHER THAN
//   POLICY and is named here so it is not mistaken for the other kind: the
//   required corroborating-signal count may be RAISED by policy but may never be
//   lowered below one, because "calendar plus at least one other indicator" is
//   the settled requirement itself (Q088.D1, and Joe's own wording on it) rather
//   than a tuning choice.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, following the sibling v5 modules deliberately:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is returned — a frozen result whose `decision` is one of
//     this module's registered values, with a stable `reason_id`. A refusal is
//     an answer the caller may record. "The calendar source is not available" is
//     one of these: an unbound or undeployed adapter is a thing a caller is
//     allowed to report, and it refuses with `calendar_source_unavailable`
//     rather than being stubbed into a pretend success.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION throws V5J201Error. Unknown fields, unknown
//     vocabulary values, open schemas, malformed Unicode, unreadable timestamps
//     and any field whose NAME reaches for audio are not policy questions; the
//     module cannot read the request at all, so it fails closed rather than
//     guessing which settled boundary was meant.
//
// THE UPSTREAM SEAM, AND WHY IT IS A SEAM. Q059.D3 and this slice's admission
// note both say to bind whichever authorized Calendar/presence adapter is
// current. V5-F10 (partner-scoped Mail and Calendar adapters) is the adapter
// that will most likely supply it, and its read contract is the shape this
// module validates against — but F10 had not merged when this slice was built,
// so THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING FROM IT. `bindMeetingSourceAdapter` takes a
// descriptor from ANY source and checks it against this module's own declared
// read contract. F10 satisfies that contract; so would a different authorized
// adapter; an absent one refuses honestly. Nothing here depends on F10 landing.
//
// THE ONE-AUTHORITY RULE. This module stores no ledger, no prompt history, no
// session, no note, no meeting and no receipt, so it creates no second
// authority. Every function is pure: no filesystem, no network, no database, no
// provider, no scheduler, no environment and no clock. Every evaluation that
// depends on time takes `now` from its caller. `V5_NO_EFFECTS` rides on every
// result to say so in the record.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not the local companion process, not a Teams or
// Zoom client, not an audio subsystem, not a notification surface, not
// persistence and not an acceptance path. It launches nothing, opens no device
// and reads no calendar; every fact it decides on is a TYPED OBSERVATION THE
// CALLER SUPPLIES. It does not make J201 complete: the companion, the prompt
// surface, the note store and the governed production outcomes are all deferred,
// and `meetingModeGaps()` says so by name.

/**
 * The governed production outcomes that gate FULL v5, quoted from the r7 design
 * basis's own receipt-producer step registry rather than restated.
 *
 * THE READING, stated so it can be checked and disagreed with rather than
 * absorbed: the registry declares SIX steps at causal phase `production_outcome`.
 * Five of them are product-level outcomes and are listed below. The sixth,
 * `step:j1-kernel-production-outcome`, is declared in the registry as a
 * dependency OF `step:j1-core-production-outcome` rather than as an outcome in
 * its own right, which is how the catalog's "five governed production outcomes
 * required for full v5" reconciles with a registry of six. That is a reading of
 * the registry, not a ruling, and the excluded sixth is named below so a reader
 * can check the reading instead of trusting it.
 *
 * NONE OF THEM IS PRODUCIBLE FROM SOURCE. Each is produced by an independent
 * outcome oracle against production, and no test, merge, configuration or
 * activation in this repository can stand in for one. `meetingModeGaps()`
 * therefore reports `full_v5_ready: false` on every input, and there is no input
 * that changes it.
