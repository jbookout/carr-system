// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02, half one: THE GATE ZERO PUBLIC SURFACE — and every
// yes it can carry is one it was handed by a bound seam, never one it computed.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DECIDE, said first because it is the whole point.
//
// (1) THE OUTCOME. Until 2026-09-11 r7 — the frozen design packet — registered
// NO producer, oracle, output schema, evidence scope or gate id for
// `step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome`. Decision
// `20c83902-f150-4d59-beca-915c5c871f95` then ruled the role provisionally, and
// on 2026-09-12 the amendment ruled on loop 589 wrote it into the packet: r7
// carries the producer row, the `gate-zero-read-only-accepted` gate and the
// `independent_control_plane_oracle` role, and the packet re-froze from
// `ef34aa54…` to `ea40f61a…`. gate-zero-producer-registration.v5.js pins that
// digest; whether a given packet IS it is decided by that module's byte
// verifier, `v5A02GateZeroR7Presence(<bytes>)`, re-exported here. The
// registration's own `r7_entry_witness` is NULL, because the packet's bytes are
// not in this repository and neither a yes nor a no may be asserted without them.
//
// THE ORACLE SEAT IS STAFFED, AND STAFFING IT MOVED NOTHING BELOW. Card 9 named
// the reviewer charter on 2026-09-11 and then staffed the desk that charter
// describes on 2026-09-13 — the independent Codex reviewer lane, under decision
// `359784f1-5d9e-4e11-bcce-af8b0dfcc5e0` — so `oracle_seat_bound` is true here,
// nothing is owed on the seat, and no governance question about it is open. The
// three evidence readers — gate-zero-seam-readers.v5.js cards 11, 12 and 13, the
// predecessor-outcome, scheduler-canary and gate-conclusion readers — ARE bound
// to this surface's seams as of 2026-09-12, which is what section (2) below is
// about.
//
// AND THE PRODUCER SEAM IS NOW BOUND, which is what PR 1013 built.
// `seam:gate-zero-read-only-outcome-producer` is implemented by
// gate-zero-producer.v5.js: it derives the rows a Gate Zero run stands on, aims
// the three bound readers at them, applies the three clauses over the readings
// and assembles one `consumer-gate-receipt.v1`. So `producer_bound` is derived
// true while card 9's seat is staffed, and `passable` follows the producer's own
// answer rather than being false by construction.
//
// WHAT THAT DID NOT CHANGE. This file still computes nothing. It holds no
// clause, reads no store and signs nothing; it asks the bound seam and reports
// what came back, and every seam is fail-closed in every direction. Put card 9's
// `holder_ref` back to null and this surface refuses again, byte for byte.
//
// (2) THE EVIDENCE, AND THIS HALF MOVED ON 2026-09-12. A caller object
// describing four accepted outcomes, a canary, a readback and a green gate graph
// is a DESCRIPTION OF EVIDENCE, not evidence, and a public function that turned
// such a description into `ok`, `green`, `joins_exactly` or `allow` would be
// handing out authority that nothing in this system holds. That is the exact
// defect the V5-A02 review of PR 985 named, and the standing rule learned from
// nine review rounds on 2026-09-11 forbids it under ANY name, including a
// "predicate", "fixture" or "unwired" variant. NONE OF THAT CHANGES.
//
// WHAT CHANGED is that three of the four seams stopped being empty. PR 1001
// built the readers for cards 11, 12 and 13 and Joe ruled all three, so an
// accepted predecessor outcome, a scheduler canary and a gate's own conclusion
// each have an authoritative surface to be read from. This module now IMPORTS
// those readers and asks the same ruling table they ask, so the three seams
// report BOUND here on exactly the condition they are open there — and report
// unbound again the moment a `decision_id:` line goes back to null.
//
// WHAT THE TWO READ SURFACES STILL ANSWER. A bound reader is a surface and not a
// subject: which accepted outcome, which canary row, which commit and which
// declared check a run stands on are the PRODUCER's derivation, not a question
// either read surface can put to a caller. So both of them still refuse, and
// they refuse for that reason rather than for a missing reader.
//
// SO THE PUBLIC SURFACE IS THIS, and it is the whole of it:
//
//   readGateZeroPredecessorJoin  -> status "unavailable"; the two ruled readers
//                                   report bound, the aiming is the producer's
//   readGateGraphAssurance       -> status "unavailable"; the ruled conclusion
//                                   reader reports bound, the aiming is the
//                                   producer's
//   emitGateZeroOutcome          -> asks the bound producer seam and reports its
//                                   answer, which is a receipt and a digest when
//                                   every derived row is there and a refusal
//                                   naming the absent one when it is not. It
//                                   still embeds no join of its own.
//
// NONE OF THE THREE READS ITS REQUEST. That is not laziness, it is the boundary:
// if no field of the request can change the answer, then no caller can smuggle
// authority in through one. `request_read: false` says so in every result.
//
// WHERE THE REAL DECISION LOGIC LIVES. The three deterministic clauses V5-A02's
// checkable_done names are implemented in PRODUCTION, in
// gate-zero-producer.v5.js, module-private to it, applied to readings taken by
// ruled readers from ruled stores. They answer held, failed or unknown about a
// row — no clause on this side of the line is written in the conditional, in any
// spelling, and the producer's own suite asserts that.
//
// A test-side helper still evaluates the same clause shapes over a CALLER'S
// object, and it has to answer conditionally because a caller's object is not
// evidence. It lives in test/, this file does not import it, and no production
// module does; gate-zero-assurance.v5.test.mjs proves the isolation with a
// parser-backed import scan of every module in mcp-server/src, and proves this
// surface with a sweep over every caller-controlled shape — including the
// reviewer's one-gate construction.
//
// THE FOUR PREDECESSORS ARE NOT THIS FILE'S CHOICE. They are the frozen plan's,
// enforced today at tools/doctorcre-v5-review.cjs:1234-1244, which asserts that
// `step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome`'s `depends_on` is exactly
// {wr46-dissolution, wr40-repository, wr54-backup-recovery, scheduler-active}.
// They are restated ONCE, in gate-zero-producer-registration.v5.js beside the
// registration they stamp, because that validator is CommonJS plan-shape code no
// ESM module can import; this module re-exports that one list rather than
// keeping a second. gate-zero-assurance.v5.test.mjs reads the validator and
// asserts the two lists are identical — so a change to the frozen plan turns
// this module's test red instead of letting the two drift apart in silence.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, inherited unchanged from global-boundaries.v5.js:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is RETURNED — `decision` is "refuse" with a stable
//     `reason_id`. Silence is never an allow, and on this surface there is no
//     allow at all.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION THROWS V5BoundaryError. Handing a producer in as a
//     second argument is not a policy question.
//
// DECISION BINDING. The catalog maps Q017.D1, Q036.D1, Q067.D1 and Q086.D1 to
// this slice. Only their ROUTING is readable: the v5 design-basis register
// carries Q001-Q015 in full and compacts everything after it to pointers whose
// own canonicalization note says to recompile the text from source item IDs in
// the originating Codex thread, which is not reachable from here. Q017's
// readable disposition is `target: assurance_fabric`, `acceptance_hook:
// assurance-fabric-child-outcome` (doctrine `doctorcre-v5-design-basis`, section
// `requirements-q016-q020`, content hash
// 68f7f22e7964d08d724bacd43e49f0ccb0d20914e354e6a87f9645331d591710). The four

 * arrow, so no behaviour moves.
 *
 * (b) `instanceof` ANSWERS FALSE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE OPERAND. Without an own
 * `Symbol.hasInstance` the intrinsic one walks the LEFT operand's prototype
 * chain, which runs the CALLER's `getPrototypeOf` trap and can hand the caller's
 * own thrown text back out of an exported callable. These exports have no
 * membership question to answer: they are functions, and nothing is an instance
 * of one. The guard is an arrow that ignores its argument, installed as a

/**
 * THE BINDINGS, AND WHAT MOVED ON 2026-09-12.
 *
 * Until PR 1001 every entry here was null and every answer below said so in the
 * only way it honestly could: no reader exists. Three of the four seams now have
 * a reader behind them — cards 11, 12 and 13, ruled by Joe on 2026-09-11 and
 * switched on by the three `decision_id:` lines of gate-zero-seam-rulings.v5.js.
 * This module IMPORTS those readers and asks THE SHARED BINDING PREDICATE —
 * `ruledCardBinding`, the one function that decides whether a card is ruled for
 * its reader — so a seam is bound here on exactly the condition it is open
 * there, and the two cannot drift. Put `null` back on a card's ruling line and
 * the seam closes in both files at once.
 *
 * AND ASKING THE TABLE DIRECTLY IS THE DEFECT THAT COST THIS SENTENCE ITS FIRST
 * VERSION. Until the PR 1004 re-review this module imported the ruling table and
 * read any non-null ruling as a bound seam — half of the reader's test, which
 * also requires the ruling to name the store that card's reader actually serves.
 * A ruling naming another registered store made this file report BOUND while the
 * reader refused it and fell back. Two predicates for one question is the bug;
 * there is now one, it lives in internal/gate-zero-seam-binding.v5.js with the
 * store table it has to agree with, and this module no longer imports the ruling
 * table at all. The predicate is shared through that INTERNAL path rather than
 * through the reader's public surface, which the third correction's review
 * required: the reader module's promise is four public names, and a predicate
 * added to it is a fifth.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT A DOOR. The readers arrive as a module-private import.
 * There is no argument, no setter, no registry keyed by anything a caller
 * controls, and no environment variable that binds a seam: the binding
 * condition is a decision id committed to a file, which is what a ruling is.
 *
 * AND THE PRODUCER SEAM IS BOUND (PR 1013). gate-zero-producer.v5.js implements
 * the pointing these readers were built for: it derives the head revision, the
 * scheduler service and the acceptance receipts from the candidate tree and the
 * ruled stores, aims all three readers at them, and signs the result with the
 * identity of the authenticated call it is running inside. `producer_bound` is
 * derived from card 9's seat exactly as before, so an unstaffed seat still
 * closes this seam and takes `passable` down with it.
 *
 * `holder` IS A THUNK, NOT A VALUE, and that is load-order and not style.
 * gate-zero-seam-readers.v5.js imports this module for its unruled answer, so
 * the two form a cycle; whichever of them a process imports first, the other's
 * body has not run yet. A thunk reads the reader binding when a caller asks,
 * by which time both modules are evaluated. Reading it eagerly here would throw
 * on the import order that starts at the readers.
