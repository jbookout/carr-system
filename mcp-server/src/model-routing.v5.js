// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F04: durable role descriptions, measured route
// qualification, deterministic route selection and the honest-unavailable path
// (decisions Q031.D1, Q047.D1, Q106.D1, Q130.D1).
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE SLICE. A ROLE is a durable job description — skills, rules,
// authority, evidence requirements, quality floors. A model/version/effort on a
// backend is an OCCUPANT of that role and is replaceable: no occupant field
// exists on a role description, so a role's digest cannot move when the occupant
// does, and the job/context/capability/receipt envelope is built with no backend
// field in its preimage at all. That is what makes "the same jobs, contexts,
// capabilities and receipts across every runtime" a property of the bytes rather
// than a promise.
//
// FOUR TRUST SEAMS, and they are the reason this file is split the way it is:
//
//   1. POLICY IS INPUT, NOT INVENTION. Every weight, rank, price, latency budget
//      and task-class permission arrives in an explicit, versioned, closed
//      `model-routing-policy.v1` document that is hashed on the way in. This
//      module invents no benchmark, no price, no numeric business floor and no
//      real model's qualification. It refuses a policy that is missing a rank or
//      a cost component rather than defaulting one, because a defaulted zero cost
//      makes an unpriced route look cheapest.
//
//      STRENGTH IS ONE DECLARED SCALE, NOT TWO NUMBER MAPS. The policy declares
//      exactly one versioned `quality_scale` — an ordered list of named grades,
//      weakest first. An occupant's strength and a role's or job's minimum
//      strength are BOTH stated as names on that same declared scale, so the
//      no-downgrade comparison is between two positions in one ordering rather
//      than between two independently-declared integers that might not share a
//      unit. A grade the scale does not list is refused; a floor no available
//      route reaches is honestly `unavailable`, never a quiet weakening.
//
//   2. QUALIFICATION IS AUTHENTICATED EVIDENCE, NOT A CALLER BOOLEAN. There is
//      no `qualified: true` field anywhere below and a closed schema refuses one.
//      A route qualifies only when a `route-qualification.v1` record — measured,
//      currently valid, and exact on task class, backend, model, version, effort,
//      tools, data classes, risk coverage and quality floors — is handed over by
//      a TRUSTED PROJECTION VERIFIER installed as server code through
//      `createModelRoutingGate`. The verifier's return is digest-bound to the
//      exact request bytes it was given, exactly as V5-A00 binds its evidence.
//      `proposeRoutePlan` runs the identical selection over UNAUTHENTICATED
//      records and says so on every field it returns: a schema-valid, ranked
//      PROPOSAL is not a qualification, and the adapter boundary refuses one.
//
//   3. COST NEVER QUALIFIES. Cost is read only to ORDER routes that already
//      qualify. A cheaper route with no qualification record, an expired one, a
//      mismatched one, or one below the required strength is refused with its own
//      reason and never selected — and when the weaker route is the only one
//      standing, the answer is an honest `unavailable`, never a quiet downgrade.
//      There is no field, flag or option anywhere here that accepts a downgrade.
//
//   4. PROVENANCE IS OBJECT IDENTITY, NOT A FLAG AND NOT A DIGEST. A decision may
//      bind an envelope only if THIS module's gate produced it; an envelope may
//      reach the adapter boundary only if `bindEnvelopeToRoute` produced it; a
//      prompt payload only if `buildPromptPayload` produced it. Each is recorded
//      in a module-private WeakSet at the moment it is frozen, and the recorded
//      key is the frozen object itself, so `{ ...boundEnvelope, route: other }`
//      is a different object and is refused however well it hashes. `digest` is
//      exported and every preimage below is public: a hash proves the bytes did
//      not change, never that this module produced them.
//
//      WHAT THAT IS WORTH, EXACTLY. A WeakSet is PROCESS-LOCAL and dies with the
//      process. It does not survive `JSON.stringify`, a queue, a database row or
//      an HTTP hop, and nothing here pretends otherwise: an envelope that crossed
//      any of those is not authentic to this module and is refused rather than
//      re-admitted on its digest. Durable, transferable authenticity needs a
//      signed capability token issued by the record layer; that does not exist in
//      this repository and is named in `v5ModelRoutingProjection` rather than
//      imitated. `proposeRoutePlan` is deliberately outside all of it: a public,
//      offline, UNAUTHENTICATED ranking that no branding will ever mark.
//
// REUSED, NOT REDECIDED. Canonical hashing is artifact-trust.js's `digest`. The
// tenant is identity.js's. The authority classes, the optional local nodes and
// their states, the local-capability fallback dispositions and the PHI boundary
// are global-boundaries.v5.js's: local availability is answered by that module's
// `evaluateLocalPlatform` and the data classes by its `evaluatePrivacyBoundary`,
// so this file holds no second privacy policy and no second local-node policy.
// The small parsing helpers are re-stated because the sibling v5 modules keep
// theirs private; they are deliberately identical in behaviour, not a new policy.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not a gateway, a provider client, a scheduler, a
// record store or an acceptance path. It reads no filesystem, no network, no
// database, no environment and no clock: every instant arrives as `now`. It
// makes no provider call and contains no code that could. `V5_NO_EFFECTS` rides
// on every result to say so.
//
// NAMED AS MISSING RATHER THAN BUILT. See `v5ModelRoutingProjection`: there is
// no live producer of `route-qualification.v1` in this repository, no durable
// record store or migration for one, and no dispatch. Those are integration and
// V5-F06/V5-F07 work. Nothing below fabricates them.

// The versioned routing policy.
//
// EVERY NUMBER IN THIS SLICE ENTERS FROM OUTSIDE. Risk and privacy ranks,
// egress classes, permitted data classes, cost components, the ranking order
// and the ordered list of quality grades are declared by the policy document
// and hashed with it; the one remaining number, measured p95 latency, arrives
// on the qualification record because it is a measurement rather than a policy.
// The module supplies the closed grammar and the deterministic comparison, and
// supplies no value of its own.
//
// STRENGTH IS COMPARED ON ONE DECLARED SCALE. `quality_scale` names the grades
// and their order; `occupant_grades` says which grade each model@version/effort
// holds; `strength_refs` says which grade each named minimum-strength reference
// requires. Both maps must name grades the scale lists, so the floor and the
// occupant are never two numbers from two unrelated scales. A floor may be
// unreachable by every route this policy declares — that is a legitimate state
// and its answer is `unavailable`, not a weaker occupant.
//
// THE RANKING ORDER IS THE POLICY'S, THE DETERMINISM IS THIS FILE'S.
// `ranking.key_order` must be an exact permutation of the six registered keys —
// not a subset, not a superset, no repeats — so a policy cannot drop a criterion
// by omission or weight one twice. Direction is fixed here and never negotiable:
// quality descends (stronger first) and every other key ascends (less risk, less
// egress, less latency, less total cost, local before non-local). Ties fall
// through to `route_key`, so no two admitted routes can ever compare equal and
// the selection is a total order.
//
// COST IS TOTAL COST, and it is summed rather than modelled: base plus the
// declared expected retry, review and fallback components. This module has no
// price list and no retry-rate estimate, so all four components are required and
// a route missing any of them is refused rather than treated as free.

 * refused by name rather than silently treated as an object. A real record-layer
