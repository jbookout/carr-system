// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02, Step B: the gateway half of the Gate Zero
// read-only outcome record.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS. The contract for one `consumer-gate-receipt.v1` as the Gate
// Zero producer emits it, and the ONE authority test that decides whether a
// transaction may record it. `mcp-server/src/tools.js` registers the verb
// `record-gate-zero-read-only-outcome` over these functions; the record layer's
// own half is `ops.gate_zero_producer_actor_id()` and
// `ops.gate_zero_record_read_only_outcome()` in migration 0502. The two are
// deliberately independent and neither substitutes for the other: a handler bug
// cannot step around the database, and a writer connection opened outside the
// gateway cannot step around the database's derivation either.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is NOT the producer. Nothing here aims the three bound
// evidence readers at rows, applies a `checkable_done` clause, or decides
// whether Gate Zero passed. That is Step A
// (`mcp-server/src/gate-zero-producer.v5.js`), which emits the receipt this file
// records. This file's whole job is to refuse everyone who is not entitled to
// sign, and to refuse a receipt whose shape does not match the one r7 registers.
//
// AND THE RECEIPT IS NOT A CALLER'S (2026-09-13, PR 1014 correction). The verb
// takes ONE argument, `idempotency_key`, and gets the receipt by invoking the
// bound producer seam: `emitGateZeroOutcome()` in gate-zero-assurance.v5.js,
// which calls Step A's zero-argument producer and hands back what it emitted.
// The first draft of this slice accepted a `receipt` object from the caller and
// persisted it, which made the durable row a statement about whatever the caller
// had assembled. There is now NO input that can carry one: a `receipt` argument
// is refused by the verb's closed input schema as an unregistered field, before
// this module is reached at all.
//
// THE NEW AUTHORITY SHAPE, AND THE RULING THAT CREATED IT. Every write verb in
// this system before this one gated on a verified human partner (`humanOnly`)
// or admitted any sponsored agent. The Gate Zero producer is neither: its role
// is `independent_control_plane_oracle` and its seat is the Codex reviewer lane,
// whose derived authority class is `review_agent` (identity.js:265-271) -- an
// identity that authenticates, resolves shared-only, and which no write verb in
// this system accepted. Joe ruled on 2026-09-13 (decision
// d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-9f1a-2b3c4d5e6f70) that this seat records the outcome row
// on its own authority, with NO partner countersign, under the card-9 charter
// ruling 8a1dad08-8707-4bb0-a159-c2831a00cea2 and the blanket approval
// 5e2b8c1a-9f47-4d63-b0e5-7a3d1c9f2e84. So the verb is `humanOnly: false` and
// refuses every actor except that one seat.
//
// `review_agent` IS NOT THE TEST, AND THIS IS THE PART A READER MUST NOT SKIM.
// `grok-reviewer` authenticates through the same review-token door and derives
// the same `review_agent` class (identity.js:31-36). A rule that admitted the
// CLASS would hand the Gate Zero signature to a second reviewer lane nobody
// ruled on. The test is the class AND the seat: the actor slug must be the LANE
// of the staffed holder ref, which is derived from
// `V5_A02_GATE_ZERO_PRODUCER_REGISTRATION.oracle_seat_holder_ref` and is `null`
// the moment that seat goes back to unstaffed. Put `holder_ref: null` back in
// gate-zero-producer-registration.v5.js and this verb refuses everyone,
// including the seat -- which is the mutation control the test suite runs.
//
// NO CALLER FIELD DECIDES ANYTHING.
//   * The seat comes from the frozen registration, never from an argument.
//   * The actor comes from the authenticated actor object the gateway resolved
//     from a Worker-secret bearer match, never from an argument.
//   * The digest is recomputed by the database from the stored receipt, so this
//     module never accepts one and never sends one.
//   * `assertNoCallerAuthorityFields` already refuses `actor`, `identity`,
//     `authorization_class` and their family at the choke point; and since there
//     is no receipt argument left, there is nothing for a caller to put an
//     identity inside either.
//   * THE NESTED IDENTITIES COME FROM THE AUTHENTICATED CALL AND ARE CHECKED
//     AGAINST IT. `producer_identity` and `evaluator_identity` must equal, field
//     for field, the `authenticated-receipt-identity.v1` that identity.js
//     derived for THIS call — the same value the producer read when it built the
//     receipt. A receipt naming a foreign session is refused here even though
//     its actor_id and authority_class are the seat's, which is the one mutation
//     a same-seat-different-session forgery would otherwise pass.
//   * THE IDENTITY OBJECT'S SHAPE IS r7's, CLOSED. `authenticated-receipt-
//     identity.v1` sets `additional_properties: false`, names exactly three
//     required fields, and gives `session_ref` a LOWERCASE pattern with a
//     minimum length. All three clauses are enforced here and again in SQL.
//
// THE DIGEST RECIPE IS A NAMED ASSUMPTION. r7's `receipt_payload_digest_rule`
// names domain tags for `benchmark-manifest.v1`, `attended-effect-capability.v1`,
// `attended-effect-consumption-receipt.v2` and
// `attended-effect-outcome-receipt.v1` -- and NOT for `consumer-gate-receipt.v1`.
// This follows the repository's existing precedent for a consumer-gate receipt
// digest: plain canonical-JSON sha256 over the receipt object with no domain tag
// (benchmark-minimum.v5.js:1480). The consistent-with-the-named-four reading
// would be `digest(["consumer-gate-receipt.v1", receipt])`, and THE TWO PRODUCE
// DIFFERENT VALUES. The digest is what a benchmark acceptance binds forever, so
// the choice is stated here rather than made silently: a reviewer who disagrees
// overturns it in one line, and if they do it becomes an r7 amendment, which
// reseals all 62 packet chunks.
