// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F10: partner-scoped Mail and Calendar adapters — the
// pure connector kernel.
//
// ONE PACKAGE, INSTALLED SEPARATELY. Q134 and Q146 ask for a single governed
// adapter that Joe and Dell each install against their OWN account on their OWN
// device, with no shared credential store, no Studio-held partner credentials,
// and no dependency running the other way into core J1. That shape is what this
// file encodes: every evaluator takes a compiled INSTALLATION as its first
// input, and an installation names exactly one partner. There is no registry of
// installations here and no way to hold two at once, because the moment one
// object can speak for both partners the isolation is a convention rather than a
// structure.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, the same distinction the rest of the v5 lane draws:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is RETURNED — a frozen result whose `decision` is
//     "allow", "refuse", "unavailable", "include", "exclude_unrelated",
//     "withhold_ambiguous" or "needs_independent_privacy_route", with a stable
//     `reason_id`. A caller may record it.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION THROWS V5F10Error. An unknown field, an unregistered
//     connector operation, an installation config carrying a credential, an item
//     carrying raw correspondence bytes, or a request to turn a WITHHELD
//     classification into an ingestion candidate are not policy questions. The
//     module cannot read the request as a governed one at all, so it fails
//     closed rather than guessing which boundary was meant.
//
// THE TWO STRUCTURAL REFUSALS THAT ARE THE POINT OF THE SLICE, and both throw:
//
//   1. CREDENTIALS NEVER LEAVE THE ORIGIN DEVICE. compilePartnerInstallation
//      scans its config's FIELD NAMES for credential-bearing fragments before it
//      reads anything else. A config carrying a token, a secret, a key or a
//      cookie has already carried it into this process; answering a policy
//      question about it would be the wrong response to a boundary that has
//      already been crossed. The installation this module compiles is an
//      identity and a scope — partner, device, account, source system — and
//      there is no field, optional or otherwise, that a secret could ride in.
//   2. RAW CORRESPONDENCE NEVER LEAVES THE ORIGIN DEVICE EITHER.
//      classifyCorrespondenceItem scans for body, attachment, preview and
//      transcript field names the same way. What crosses this seam is a CONTENT
//      DIGEST and typed metadata — the exact shape F01's admitCorporateArtifact
//      already takes, which is why the minimum-necessary boundary costs nothing
//      to honour here. This module reads no message text and cannot.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE, because something else in this tree already
// does and a second authority for a settled thing is a defect:
//
//   * THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY IS S01's. evaluatePrivacyBoundary decides whether a
//     declared class may be carried; nothing here re-implements the PHI list or
//     the aggregate privacy route, and the refusal ids are carried through
//     verbatim. Classification is MANDATORY on every item and is evaluated
//     BEFORE relevance, exactly as admitCorporateArtifact evaluates it before it
//     builds an artifact: an item excluded as "unrelated" without ever meeting
//     the privacy boundary would be content that was never classified at all,
//     which is not the same as content that was classified and dropped.
//   * NATIVE IDENTITY IS F01's. The (source_system, native_id, native_id_epoch)
//     triple, the recycled-epoch rule and the field-level transition all live in
//     record-source-authority.v5.js. This module groups a device's queue BY that
//     triple and never re-decides it: an epoch split is NAMED and both sides are
//     forwarded, so F01 refuses the recycled one against established state
//     rather than this module refusing it a second time from less information.
//   * ADMISSION IS F01's. toCorporateArtifactCandidate builds the request shape
//     admitCorporateArtifact takes and stops there. Every result says
//     `admitted: false`. Calling the admission from inside an adapter would be a
//     second door into the record layer.
//   * PARTNERHOOD IS identity.js's. isKnownPartner decides who is a partner.
//
// TAINT IS NEVER LOWERED AT THIS SEAM. Outlook is a registered authoritative
// home and a mailbox item's custody is corporate, but the VALUE crossing here
// describes correspondence authored outside CARR. Following the precedent
// context-assembly-source.v5.js set for adapter boundaries, every candidate
// takes `untrusted_external` and the caller cannot supply a taint class at all —
// a field it could set would be a laundering seam.
//
// THE JUDGEMENT CALL, named rather than buried. F01 registers five evidence
// classes and none of them is a calendar class. A calendar event in Exchange is
// a mailbox item — it lives in the same store, under the same account, with the
// same change key — so both item kinds map to `corporate_mailbox_item`, and the
// F10-side `item_kind` is carried separately so the distinction is never lost.
// The alternative, a sixth F01 evidence class, is an F01-owned change and this
// slice does not make it; see `no_calendar_evidence_class` in
// partnerConnectorGaps().
//
// THE OFFLINE QUEUE IS A READ QUEUE, AND Q007.D1 IS WHY THAT MATTERS. V5 does
// not accept offline mutations. Nothing queued here is a mutation: every entry
// is an OBSERVATION the device made of its own mailbox, held until the device
// can hand it over. `accepts_offline_mutation: false` rides on every queue
// result, and the constant is proved against S01's own policy in the suite so
// the two cannot drift apart silently.
//
// THE MODULE IS PURE. No filesystem, no network, no database, no scheduler, no
// environment, no clock: `now` arrives from the caller on every evaluation that
// needs it. It sends nothing, persists nothing, activates nothing and accepts
// nothing. V5_NO_EFFECTS rides on every result to say so in the record.
//
// AND IT PRODUCES NO ACCEPTANCE. The consumer gate
// `partner-mail-calendar-connectors-accepted` is produced by an independent
// oracle against production partner devices. Deploying an adapter does not
// satisfy it and neither does passing this suite. evaluateIngestionScope says so
// in its own answer rather than leaving a reader to infer it, and combined
// Joe/Dell correspondence coverage is UNAVAILABLE from this module under every
// input it can be handed.

 *     forwards both rather than refusing one from less context.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE IT REFUSES OUTRIGHT is the case nobody downstream can untangle:
