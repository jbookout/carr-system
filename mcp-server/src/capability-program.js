// twenty-two build items does not protect the queue, it is what makes the queue

// tests the row's disposition, not the caller's convenience. The version check is
// unchanged, so a stale read still refuses. The decline still pays the whole

    // and complete each assume the session that opened will eventually close.
    // Nothing expressed the ordinary case where it does not: a session opens a
    // build session, freezes a candidate, and then the reason for the work goes
    // away — the decision it was carrying is reversed, the row is reprioritised,
    // or the session simply dies.
    //
    // IT COST A REAL ROW. On 2026-08-24 a session took WR-AI-038, the
    // transformer row, as far as `verification` with a frozen decline candidate
    // and stopped. On 2026-08-26 Joe ruled that the whole suite stays in place
    // and no further declines are to be recorded, which made finishing that
    // candidate forbidden — and there was no other move. A check across all 183
    // deployed verbs found nothing that could release it. The row could be
    // neither completed nor abandoned, and the partial unique index
    // capability_one_open_session_per_request meant its dead session also blocked
    // any future attempt on the same row. One unfinished session had made the row
    // permanently unworkable.
    //
    // WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, because a cancel is the cheapest verb to make
    // dangerous. It never touches a confirmed_closed row: requireProject only
    // returns rows that are not closed, so a settled close cannot be undone by
    // calling this instead of arguing with the immutability trigger. It never
    // deletes evidence — the session is moved to 'cancelled' and keeps its
    // candidate, and any attestation already recorded against it stays exactly
    // where it is, because what happened did happen. It records a REASON and
    // refuses without one, which is the same rule the canonical machine applies
    // to every other side exit.
    //
    // THE SESSION ID IS RESOLVED, NOT SUPPLIED, and that is deliberate. Its
    // siblings take capability_agent_session_id because the caller is expected
    // to be holding the session it just created. A cancel is used by whoever
    // finds the wreck, and the session id of a non-head row is not exposed by any
    // read verb — demanding it would make the verb unusable in exactly the
    // situation it exists for. The partial unique index guarantees at most one
    // open session per row, so there is nothing to disambiguate, and base_version
    // still refuses a stale read. Passing the id is allowed and is verified when
