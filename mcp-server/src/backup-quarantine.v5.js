// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-F08 — the typed ONE-WAY QUARANTINE ADMISSION contract
// and the CLASSIFY-OR-PURGE terminal reconciliation (requirement Q034).
//
// This closes catalog `checkable_done` items 1, 2 and 3 — "scanner refuses PHI,
// credentials, nested archives and unclassified opaque/encrypted content",
// "only enumerated PHI-incapable source enters one-way quarantine", and "every
// quarantine object reaches exact classify-or-purge receipt" — as pure
// evaluators over typed observations. Items 4, 5 and 6 are NOT decided here and
// the reason is written down rather than implied; see WHAT IS DEFERRED below.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT, said first because "backup" invites the wrong reading.
// It is not a backup workflow, not a scanner, not a quarantine store and not a
// restore controller. It copies nothing, reads no source bytes, opens no file,
// runs no scanner, keeps no inventory and issues no receipt. Every fact it
// decides on is a TYPED OBSERVATION THE CALLER SUPPLIES. An `admit` from here
// says the eleven registered negatives did not fire on the facts as reported;
// it moves no object anywhere, and every result says so in its own fields.
//
// THE SCANNER IS THE THING THAT PRODUCES THE OBSERVATION; THIS MODULE DECIDES
// ON IT. The catalog's concrete output says to "reuse the existing non-retaining
// source scanner where valid" — and there is no such scanner in this repository
// (see V5_NON_RETAINING_SCANNER_SEAM). Writing one here would be worse than
// shipping the gap twice over: a byte-level PHI classifier invented in this file
// would be a SECOND privacy authority beside global-boundaries.v5.js, and the
// slice's own model_judgment_boundary reserves pass/fail to deterministic checks
// and an independent oracle rather than to a classifier's opinion. So the scan
// arrives as a REPORT, its findings are read rather than derived, and a report
// that does not say is treated as a block rather than as a clean bill.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, inherited unchanged from global-boundaries.v5.js:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is RETURNED — a frozen result whose `decision` is "admit"
//     or "refuse" with a stable `reason_id`. A refusal is an answer the caller
//     may record. "I cannot say" is one of these: a scan that did not assess
//     credentials is a thing a caller is allowed to report, and it BLOCKS.
//     Silence is never an admission.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION THROWS V5BoundaryError. Unknown fields, unknown
//     states, open schemas and malformed digests are not policy questions; the
//     module cannot read the request at all, so it fails closed rather than
//     guessing which negative was meant.
//
// NO CALLER MAY NAME WHICH CHECKS APPLY, OR ASSERT ITS OWN ADMISSIBILITY.
// `trusted`, `skip_scan`, `already_reviewed` and `phi_free` are unknown fields,
// so a request that tries to narrow the test cannot be read at all. The check
// list is a module constant, in a fixed order, and the order is load-bearing:
// the first check that does not pass refuses, and everything after it reports
// `not_reached`. THE FIVE SOURCE CHECKS COME FIRST, so an unenumerated source is
// refused BEFORE any content fact about it is read at all. That is what makes
// "only enumerated PHI-incapable source enters quarantine" a structural property
// of this file rather than a promise about it: a source nobody put on the list
// cannot be rescued by a clean scan, because its scan is never reached.
//
// THE ROSTER IS AN INPUT AND NO ROSTER SHIPS HERE. Which sources are enumerated
// PHI-incapable is an assessment a human performs about real systems; this
// repository holds no such enumeration and inventing one would ship an invented
// binding. So the roster arrives the way the supervisor registry arrives in
// command-supervisor-admission.v5.js: caller-supplied, SEALED, and with each
// entry's own digest RECOMPUTED here, so an entry re-pointed after signing
// refuses. A caller can therefore only widen the roster by re-sealing it, which
// is a visible act rather than a field on a request.
//
// PHI IS NOT RE-DECIDED HERE. `declared_data_class_boundary` calls S01's
// evaluatePrivacyBoundary and reads its answer. A second implementation of the
// privacy boundary would be a second place for it to disagree, and the class
// vocabulary, the prohibited set and the aggregate route already live there.
// This module adds no data class and holds no second privacy registry.
//
// WHAT IS DEFERRED, AND WHY IT IS NOT GUESSED HERE. Catalog items 4, 5 and 6 —
// restore from an independently controlled copy with an exact watermark/hash,
// the RPO/RTO cells passing independently, and outbound queues quarantining
// until reconciliation — are named seams below and decided by nothing in this
// file. Every one of them is blocked on a fact this repository does not hold:
// Q034.D1's settled text is doctrine-store text and is absent from
// V5_SETTLED_DECISIONS, `independent_restore_oracle` is a registered producer
// role in benchmark-minimum.v5.js with no gate member naming its step, and the
// business-day calendar the "<= 1 business day" adapter cell would be measured
// against is defined nowhere here. The seams are hashed into the policy
// preimage, so the day any of them is written the policy digest moves and stale
// readers are refused rather than silently reading a policy that now decides
// more than it did.

// Nothing situational is bound — no source, object, roster, scanner, actor or
// acceptance fact — so two callers describing the same policy reach the same
// digest. The digest is an identity for these bytes and nothing else: it is not
// an acceptance, not a receipt, and not evidence for any consumer gate.
//
// EVERY CLOSED VOCABULARY THIS MODULE DECIDES AGAINST IS ENUMERATED HERE. A
// vocabulary that is not in the preimage can change without the policy digest
// moving, which is how a consumer ends up pinned to a policy it is no longer
// reading. Every list is sorted EXPLICITLY rather than left in declaration
// order, so the digest is stable by construction rather than by the luck of a
// list that happens to be alphabetical today.
