// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A05 — delivery cadence, escalation and the
// decision-ready quiet-hours queue.
//
// Catalog entry (doctrine document `doctorcre-v5-astra-integration-review`,
// section "DoctorCRE v5: reviewed coding slices, scope contracts and parallel
// groups", `proposed_id: "V5-A05"`), goal verbatim: "Keep assurance one risk
// ahead while surfacing only decisions and urgent harms at the right time."
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS, unlike its two dependencies. V5-A01 and V5-A03 both
// discovered that the thing their checkable_done asked them to prove required
// an authoritative store this repository does not have, and each therefore
// answers "unavailable" on every input, forever, naming the seam it is owed.
// V5-A05's three checkable_done items are different in kind: whether a 14-day
// interval has been kept, whether a reason names an urgent harm, and whether an
// item needs Joe's authority are each decidable from the request alone, with no
// registry, ledger or receipt store standing behind the answer. So this module
// answers for real, on every well-formed request — it is not a stub waiting on
// a later seam, and it does not report `unavailable`.
//
// The module is pure, exactly as global-boundaries.v5.js is pure: it reads no
// filesystem, no network, no database, no scheduler and no clock. Every
// evaluation that depends on time takes `now` from its caller, so two callers
// holding the same request always reach the same answer, and nothing here can
// reset a clock to make a miss disappear (excluded_scope: "clock reset").
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE, matching the catalog's excluded_scope:
//   * "assurance-complete-before-product"  — this module states cadence and
//     escalation facts; it does not gate product delivery on them.
//   * "engagement notifications"           — an item that is neither urgent
//     nor authority-requiring gets `no_queue_entry`. It is never surfaced to
//     Joe as an FYI; that is a different, unbuilt surface.
//   * "automatic authority widening"       — the ONLY things that can make an
//     item wake Joe are the closed urgent-reason vocabulary and the two
//     caller-asserted booleans this module's request schema names outright
//     (`requires_joe_authority`, `unresolved_intent`). No other field, however
//     labelled, can raise an item's routing — the request schemas are closed
//     and an unknown field is a contract violation, not a policy question.
//   * "clock reset"                        — see above.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, inherited from global-boundaries.v5.js:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is returned — a frozen result whose `decision` or
//     `routing` is one of a closed set, with a stable `reason_id`.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION throws V5BoundaryError — unknown fields, unknown
//     reason ids, non-monotonic history and unreadable timestamps are not
//     policy questions; the module fails closed rather than guessing.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT CLAIM. It was built from the catalog entry's own
// fields (goal, concrete_output, included/excluded scope, checkable_done,
// decision_ids), read verbatim from the doctrine store. It was NOT built from
// the verbatim text of decisions Q008.D2, Q013.D1, Q027.D1, Q045.D1 or Q131.D1
// — those sentences were not independently retrieved for this build, unlike
// V5-A03's five settled decisions, which were. `assertA05CatalogBinding` below
// therefore binds a caller to the CATALOG ENTRY this module was built from, not
// to the underlying decision text, and says so in its own field names rather
// than implying a binding this module cannot prove.
