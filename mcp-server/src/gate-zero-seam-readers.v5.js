// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02, the seam half: THE THREE READERS GATE ZERO IS
// OWED — built, tested, and ON.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Gate Zero's own path refuses with
// `predecessor_outcome_reader_unavailable`, and it refuses BEFORE it looks at
// any Work Request, because nothing on that path can read the evidence it would
// join. Four seams are owed. Cards 11, 12 and 13 of JOE-GATE-ZERO-CARDS.md
// named a store for three of them, and JOE HAS RULED all three. The decision
// ids are live on the three `decision_id:` lines of
// gate-zero-seam-rulings.v5.js:
//
//   card 11  16c7cdfb-b675-4b6a-bbff-4bbdab46baf8 — which store an accepted
//            predecessor outcome comes from (record layer Work Request outcome
//            feedback)
//   card 12  f7c486d6-5bee-4c4c-a76f-c0f162f66db8 — which scheduler surface
//            supplies a canary and the observation after it (ops.service and
//            ops.run)
//   card 13  87e9e11e-64b2-49b3-a6aa-4901c24eaa91 — which surface reports a
//            gate's own conclusion (the GitHub checks API)
//
// So all three readers read, and not one line of this file was written the day
// those rulings landed: the whole switch is those three lines in the ruling
// table. It turns both ways — put `null` back on a card's `decision_id:` line
// and that card's reader goes back to handing over the gate's own refusal,
// without opening its store.
//
// THE RULING GATE, and it is the first thing every reader does.
//
//   1. Ask the ruling table whether THIS CARD is ruled, by card token.
//   2. If it is not — which for these three cards means a `null` or a
//      malformed id put back on its ruling line — RETURN THE GATE'S OWN
//      REFUSAL, by calling
//      `readGateZeroPredecessorJoin()` or `readGateGraphAssurance()` and
//      returning what they return, unmodified. Not a copy, not a lookalike: the
//      gate's own function's own answer, so the two cannot drift.
//   3. If the ruling names a store this card's reader does not serve, that is
//      also not a ruling for this reader, and step 2 stands.
//   4. Only then look at the query. Only then open the store.
//
// The order is the point. A reader that validated the query first would leak
// which queries are well-formed; a reader that opened its store first would
// have read an unruled store even if it threw the answer away. Half an answer
// from an unruled store is still an unruled read.
//
// THE PUBLIC SURFACE IS FOUR NAMES. Three readers and a schema version string.
// There is no exported classifier, no exported predicate, no exported ruling
// table, no exported findings vocabulary and no exported status object. The
// derivation — the part that turns rows into a finding — is module-private,
// below, and there is no route to it that does not go through a reader that has
// already checked a ruling and fetched the rows itself. The ruling predicate the
// GATE also asks is shared rather than copied, and it is not a fifth name here
// either: it lives in internal/gate-zero-seam-binding.v5.js, which this module
// and gate-zero-assurance.v5.js import by that path and neither re-exports.
//
// WHAT A CALLER MAY SAY, AND WHAT IT MAY NEVER SAY. A query ADDRESSES a row:
// which predecessor step, which service and canary, which commit and check.
// Addressing is not asserting. There is no argument for a decision id, a store
// handle, a connection, a reader object, a row, a receipt or an outcome — and
// there is no environment variable that opens a seam either. The only way to
// change what these functions answer is to change what is in the store, or to
// paste a ruling into a file and commit it.
//
// NO CALLER TEXT COMES BACK OUT, AND NO STORE TEXT EITHER. Every query field is
// taken through a try/catch (a Proxy trap or a throwing getter is caught, not
// propagated) and then matched against a strict pattern. A field that passes is
// USED and never echoed. What a result carries instead is `query_digest` — a
// digest over the NORMALIZED query — plus counts, closed-vocabulary enums, and
// identifiers taken from this module's own frozen tables. Free text out of a
// store does not reach an answer either: not a feedback ref, not a stored
// outcome, not a timestamp. Hand these functions a hostile object and the answer
// contains none of its bytes; point them at a store full of hostile rows and the
// answer contains none of those either.
//
// NO PRIVILEGED WORD COMES OUT, AND THERE IS NO EXEMPTION LIST. The union the
// standing rule closes — allow, commit, prompt, suppress, release, read,
// covered, drafted, proposed, queued, healthy, passing, ok, pass, satisfied,
// complete, admitted, resumed, attended, verified, present, equivalent,
// operational, active, green, joins_exactly, coverage_complete, favorable,
// anything `would_*`, anything `*_if_authoritative` — appears in NO value any
// export of this module returns, as word, as token or as raw substring, and the
// test sweeps for it with no carve-out at all.
//
// The earlier draft of this module needed a carve-out, because it reused the
// gate's own reason ids and seam names verbatim and those contain "read"
// ("read-only", "readback") and "active" ("scheduler-active-receipt"). That
// carve-out is deleted. Two things replaced it, and neither is an exemption:
//
//   * The seams are addressed by OPAQUE CARD TOKENS — "card:11", "card:12",
//     "card:13" — everywhere a value could carry one. A gate seam name never
//     enters an answer this module builds.
//   * This module's own finding vocabulary is its own. `scheduler_readback_*`
//     became `scheduler_observation_*`. The clause is the same clause; the word
//     is one this module is free to choose, and it chose one with no privileged
//     substring in it.
//
// What remains is the UNRULED answer, which is not this module's output at all:
// it is the gate's object, returned by delegation. The test does not sweep it
// for words — it pins it, whole, by digest, to what `gate-zero-assurance.v5.js`
// returns on main. That is strictly stronger than a word sweep, because
// identity admits no new string of any kind, privileged or not.
//
// THE FOURTH SEAM IS NOT BUILT, AND IS NOT COPIED HERE.
// `seam:gate-zero-read-only-outcome-producer` is cards 9 and 10 — which
// independent seat holds the oracle, and whether r7 itself carries the
// registration. Those are not questions about where to read from; they are
// questions about who signs. Its refusal is `emitGateZeroOutcome()` in
// gate-zero-assurance.v5.js, which already says all of it; an earlier draft
// carried a written-out copy of that refusal as an exported constant, and the
// copy has been deleted rather than kept in sync. One place says it.
//
// WHAT IS STILL OWED AFTER A RULING, said now so nobody reads a ruling as more
// than it is: WHICH canary the scheduler reader should be pointed at, and WHICH
// commit and check the conclusion reader should be pointed at, are the
// consumer's bindings, and the consumer is the Gate Zero producer — the seam
// that is deliberately not built. These readers will answer truthfully about
// whatever row they are pointed at. Pointing them is the producer's job.

 * and an `invalid_field` of `checkName`. `pg_dump -> age-encrypt -> artifact`
 * was refused too, for the `>`. A reader whose validator was invented rather
 * than read off the workflows could not have admitted either.
 *
 * SO THE VALIDATOR IS AN ENUMERATION, READ OFF THE DECLARING FILES. Every entry
 * below is the name GitHub gives a check run for one declared job, or the name
 * this repository's own code posts a check run under. A job's check-run name is
 * its `name:` when it has one and its job id when it does not, which is why
 * `merge` is in the list spelled the way source-merge-controller.yml spells the
 * job.
 *
 *   .github/workflows/automerge-pilot.yml:25   Plan against current GitHub evidence
 *   .github/workflows/automerge-pilot.yml:91   Read-only exact merge-ref verification
 *   .github/workflows/automerge-pilot.yml:178  Conditional squash merge from protected main

 *   .github/workflows/edge-liveness.yml:70     is anything that should be reporting not reporting
 *   .github/workflows/main-canary.yml:77       main canary (gates, migration, types, freshness)
 *   .github/workflows/source-merge-controller.yml:20  merge   (job id; the job declares no name:)
 *   ops/backup-workflow-status.py:45           Backup artifact   (CHECK_NAME, posted by create_check)
 *
 * WHY A SET AND NOT A WIDER PATTERN, and the two clauses it reconciles. A
 * pattern that admitted every name above would have to admit `,` `>` and `/`,
 * because declared names contain all three — at which point "reject path
 * separators" is no longer something the validator does. An enumeration rejects
 * a newline, rejects a separator, and rejects three hundred characters for the
 * same reason it rejects everything else: the string is not one of ten literal
 * names this module wrote down. The only `/` and `>` that reach the store are
 * this module's own two, out of this module's own constant, and they reach it as
 * an `encodeURIComponent`-ed query parameter rather than as a path segment.
 *
 * THIS IS AN ADDRESS, NOT AN AUTHORITY. A caller still chooses WHICH declared
 * check to ask about, exactly as it chooses which commit; what it cannot do is
 * name a check that no workflow declares, and it never chose the answer. The set
 * is module-private and frozen, and nothing exported hands it back.
 *
 * WHEN A WORKFLOW ADDS A JOB this list is wrong, and it is wrong quietly —
 * a reader would refuse the new check instead of reading it. So the test file
 * derives the same set a second time by parsing `.github/workflows/*.yml` and
 * `ops/backup-workflow-status.py`, and fails when the two disagree. That test is

 *     that required one could never match a real row, and an earlier draft of
 *     this file required exactly that.
 *   bin/run-scheduled.sh — the scheduler wrapper writes
 *     `--source-kind wrapper --source-ref bin/run-scheduled.sh`.
 *
 * So "the scheduler wrote it, not a hand-run" is: source_kind is `wrapper` AND
 * source_ref is that script. An `operator` row is a hand-run and a `collector`
 * row is a probe; neither is a dispatch this clause will speak for.
 *
 * AND A RECEIPT IS NOT A STRING THE LEDGER HAPPENED TO HOLD. Until 2026-09-11
 * bin/run-scheduled.sh passed no `--evidence-ref` at all, so every row it wrote
 * carried evidence_ref null and this clause could not be met by any scheduled
 * run in the ledger's history. The wrapper now MINTS its own receipt after its
 * child exits — no flag, no path, nothing a caller or the child can hand it —
 * and that receipt carries, in its own bytes, which run it is for and when it
 * was minted. So "bound to a receipt" is three questions and not one: the ref
 * is there, it is FOR THIS RUN (the run-key hash the receipt carries equals the
 * hash of the row's own run key), and it was minted AFTER the row's dispatch. A

//      a near miss; a proposal nobody signed is not an outcome.
//   2. The row is COMPLETE: an acceptance receipt whose matching card detail is
//      absent is a missing row, and a missing row refuses. The store COUNTS the
//      card rows it found for the receipt rather than synthesizing a
//      null-outcome row that looks accepted — and it is a count rather than the
//      boolean it shipped as, because a bare `true` out of an exported function
//      is the shape the standing rule closes over.
//   3. That row's ACCEPTANCE RECEIPT hash equals the outcome hash this reader
//      was asked about. Not the proposal's `feedback_hash` — the receipt's,
//      because the receipt is the row a human's acceptance wrote and the
//      proposal is the row a machine wrote. A forged or stale hash therefore
//      does not merely fail to match a proposal; it fails to match a signature.
//
// None of the three can be satisfied by the `outcomeHash` argument: it is
// compared against a stored value and never returned, so a caller who supplies
// a hash learns only whether the store agrees with it.

// that makes it true, rather than three implementations each remembering not to
// let anything escape. `reason()` and `finding()` raise on an unregistered id;

// ENGINE-BUILT STACK — a list of the caller's own frame names and file paths,
// bytes this module did not write. A caller function named `green` calling a
// reader that threw got `at green` handed back to it.
//
// So every export is the same wrapper over a module-private implementation, and
// what it answers when anything at all is thrown is the GATE'S OWN ANSWER for
// that card — the identical object the reader returns while the card is unruled.
// That is fail-closed by construction: the worst a thrown value can do is make a

// AMENDMENT 2'S CLOSED SHAPE COMES FROM ./closed-callable.js (amendment 9, fifth
// correction round, 2026-09-14). This file used to define its own copy, on the
// argument that a self-contained module is worth a duplicated primitive. The
// review measured that argument against the copies and it failed: the local
// copies had already DIVERGED from the shared one — they never froze the
// callable, which is clause (c), the clause the first shape enumeration added
// after finding it missing — so the file whose whole job is to close a probe was
// running the unhardened version of the shape. A security primitive that exists
// five times is hardened in one of five places. There is one definition now, and
// the enumeration control walks every export against it.

// AND THE BOUNDARY HAS TO COVER `new`, WHICH IT DOES BY LEAVING NOTHING TO
// CONSTRUCT. The fourth review round found that an async function has no
// [[Construct]] at all, so `Reflect.construct` on one is refused by the ENGINE
// before the function starts; the third correction answered that with a Proxy
// whose construct trap returned the gate's own answer, and the fifth round found
// what that proxy still forwarded — `get`, and with it the raw target under
// `prototype.constructor`, constructable with a `new.target` of the caller's
// choosing.
//
// So the wrapper is gone and every export is an ARROW FUNCTION. An arrow is not
// a constructor and has no `prototype`, so there is no target to reach and no
// `newTarget.prototype` read on the way in: construction is refused by the
// engine, in the caller's own frame, having run no line of this module. That is
// clause (a) of amendment 2, and the refusal is out of scope as a finding for
// exactly the reason it is safe — nothing here executed, so nothing here can
// have read the caller's object or written the sentence that comes back.
//
// The arrow returns the async work as a promise, so every caller sees what it
// saw before, and the CALLING door still answers with the gate's own object.
