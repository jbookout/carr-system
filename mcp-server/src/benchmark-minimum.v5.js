// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A00: the CLOSED benchmark contract and the deterministic
// Foundation/Assurance minimum receipt join (requirement Q012, decision Q012.D1,
// gate obligation Q012.D2).
//
// TWO THINGS LIVE HERE and they are deliberately different in kind:
//
//   1. benchmark-manifest.v1 — a CLOSED schema of exactly thirty fields whose
//      SLO, cost and clock constants are identity, not configuration. This file
//      can compute the exact payload digest a verified partner would have to
//      accept, and can authenticate an acceptance envelope that already exists.
//      It CANNOT accept. Acceptance is a human act performed elsewhere by the
//      verified_partner_benchmark_authority; the four envelope fields
//      (benchmark_manifest_digest, accepted_by_identity, accepted_at, status)
//      are recorded by the gateway from that act and are never caller-created
//      authority. `evaluateBenchmarkAdmissibility` proposes; it never accepts.
//
//   2. step:foundation-assurance-minimum-receipt — the join over eight consumed
//      gates. It produces a PROPOSED consumer-gate-receipt.v1, never an issued
//      one. `issued`, `persisted` and `clock_started` are false on every result
//      and there is no code path that sets them true, because durable issuance
//      and the Journey 1 clock origin belong to adapters this file does not
//      contain and cannot reach.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not a gateway, an issuer, a persistence layer, a
// clock, an acceptance path or an activation path. It reads no filesystem, no
// network, no database, no environment and no clock: every instant comes from
// the authenticated `as_of`. `V5_NO_EFFECTS` rides on every result to say so.
//
// AUTHENTICATION IS AN INSTALLED CODE DEPENDENCY, NEVER A JSON CLAIM. The join
// is reachable only through createFoundationAssuranceMinimumGate, whose
// `authenticateEvidence` is trusted server code that authenticates the RAW
// artifacts, the LIVE identities, their currentness, and the exact digest of the
// supplied envelope. Ordinary request JSON cannot install it, and no field named
// `verified_human`, `partner_confirmed` or similar exists anywhere below: a
// closed schema refuses one. `authority_class` is likewise not self-asserted —
// the verifier must derive it from identity.js's authorizationClassForActor over
// the LIVE actor, exactly as global-boundaries.v5.js does, and must never read
// it back out of a stored record. A projection that copies a stored class string
// turns the partner test into the caller boolean this file forbids.
//
// REUSED, NOT REDECIDED. Canonical hashing is artifact-trust.js's `digest`; the
// partner predicate is identity.js's `isKnownPartner`; the deadline contract is
// journey-one-clock.v5.js's JOURNEY_ONE_DEADLINE_CONTRACT, reconciled against
// the manifest's own closed deadline_contract at module load (see
// BENCHMARK_DEADLINE_CONTRACT) so the two can never drift into two authorities.
// The small parsing helpers below are re-stated rather than imported because the
// equivalents in the sibling v5 modules are private to those files; they are
// deliberately identical in behaviour, not a second policy.
//
// FIVE PLACES WHERE r7 IS SILENT, stated rather than papered over:
//
//   * step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome HAS NO ENTRY in r7's
//     receipt_producer_step_registry. Eight producers depend on it and the item
//     catalog lists it as an evidence input, but it declares no producer role,
//     oracle, output schema, evidence scope or produced gate id. This file
//     therefore refuses to invent a Gate Zero receipt schema. It requires the
//     authenticated projection to carry the Gate Zero outcome as an
//     authenticated fact — an outcome digest and an observed instant — and it
//     enforces the one ordering the catalog does settle: every member, the
//     benchmark acceptance in particular, and the benchmark coverage fact below,
//     must be observed STRICTLY after it. r7 is silent on the boundary instant
//     itself, so the exclusive reading is stated here rather than left to differ
//     between the paths: a member observed AT the Gate Zero instant is refused
//     exactly as an acceptance or an evaluation recorded at that instant is.
//   * consumer-gate-receipt.v1 declares twenty-one required fields, no
//     `schema_version` among them, and additional_properties false — so an
//     r7-exact receipt carries no schema_version and one that does is refused
//     here. The M01 clock kernel reads that same twenty-one-field shape, so the
//     FIELD SET no longer diverges and one receipt has one canonical form and
//     one digest on both sides of the seam.
//   * r7's benchmark denial_rule denies an "unevaluated" manifest, but r7
//     declares NO measurement schema and no coverage fact a join could consume,
//     so `doctorcre-v5-benchmark-coverage-fact.v1` below is module-local and
//     namespaced as one. The join REQUIRES it on the projection, bound to the
//     exact accepted PAYLOAD digest the way the Gate Zero outcome is bound to
//     its outcome digest, and REFUSES a projection that omits it — an accepted
//     manifest and a measured one are no longer indistinguishable here. What
//     the join re-derives itself, from the accepted payload alone, is every
//     part of the fact that does not need the samples: the required cell count,
//     the complete set of SLO keys, and that each reported worst p95 belongs to
//     a REQUIRED cell of the metric that owns its threshold and is at or under
//     it. `coverage_complete: true` therefore cannot pass on its own — the
//     counts and the per-key p95 proof beside it have to agree with the
//     accepted manifest — and a raw caller boolean has no field to live in.
//     What the join CANNOT re-derive is that `measurement_set_digest` and
//     `evaluation_digest` name a stored measurement set and an evaluation that
//     actually produced those numbers. That is a verifier obligation, named
//     under WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK and not assumed satisfied here; the
//     fact is refused when it is absent, mismatched, stale or non-passing, and
//     it is never called verified merely because this module can compose one.
//
// THE M01 SEAM, in full. journey-one-clock.v5.js consumes what this module
// proposes. The field set is now identical; its VALUE DOMAINS are still narrower
// than r7's in two places. A00 stays on the r7-exact side of both — r7's
// accepted values are preserved and no new global cap is invented here — and the
// seam is where the mismatch is made visible, never where evidence is quietly
// repaired:
//
//   1. FIELD SET — RECONCILED, and the reconciliation is load-bearing.
//      `journeyOneClockMinimumReceiptView` returns the twenty-one r7 fields
//      unchanged, so `digest(view) === digest(proposed_receipt)` is the exact
//      `origin_receipt_digest` M01 records and every pause and amendment binds
//      to. An adapter that added a field would give the same receipt two
//      identities and leave a durable store unable to find the origin the clock
//      names.
//   2. REFERENCE DOMAIN. M01 caps every `safe:` and `session:` reference at 300
//      characters. r7 declares minLength 1 and NO maximum, so this file declares
//      none either: an r7-legal evidence_ref longer than 300 characters is
//      admissible evidence HERE and is refused by M01. The view therefore
//      REJECTS such a receipt with `m01_incompatible_evidence_ref` (or
//      `m01_incompatible_session_ref`) rather than truncating it — a truncated
//      reference is a different reference, and shortening evidence to fit a
//      consumer is the one repair this seam must never perform.
//   3. TIMESTAMP DOMAIN. `ISO_INSTANT` here accepts 1..9 fractional-second
//      digits, as r7's date-time does; M01's stamp accepts 1..3. The proposed
//      receipt is safe in practice only because `iso()` emits exactly three, so
//      the view rejects a wider instant with `m01_incompatible_timestamp` rather
//      than rounding it.
//
// A FOURTH, SEPARATE MISMATCH, which the view does not and must not touch: the
// accepted manifest's `deadline_contract` carries the pause budget in DAYS and
// M01's projection field `benchmark.deadline_contract` is compared against the
// HOURS variant. The module-load reconciliation below keeps the two from
// drifting; it does NOT convert between them, and nothing in this file converts
// a manifest deadline_contract into an M01 projection deadline_contract. Doing
// that automatically would make a unit assumption on the caller's behalf, which
// is precisely what carrying two unit conventions exists to prevent. Building
// the M01 projection is integration work, named below.
//   * `outlier_rule` is free text (5..300 chars). No engine can execute a
//     sentence, so this file BINDS it (a measurement set must quote the accepted
//     rule byte-for-byte) and BOUNDS it (exclusions may never take a cell below
//     samples_per_cell) without pretending to apply it.
//   * cost_variance_thresholds are enforced as exact constants. r7 defines no
//     variance measure or denominator, so no cost-variance evaluator is written
//     here; inventing one would be a second cost authority.
//
// WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK, named rather than implied:
//   * Durable issuance of the proposed receipt, and the compare-and-swap that
//     makes the FIRST such issuance the clock origin. Returning a proposed
//     receipt does not claim it was persisted, which is why every result carries
//     durable_receipt_issuance_required.
//   * The live admission adapter that authenticates raw evidence into the
//     projection this file consumes.
//   * Recording a verified partner's exact-hash benchmark acceptance into the
//     four-field envelope. This file verifies such an envelope; it cannot make one.
//   * Bounding the PROPOSED receipt's own TTL against the DOWNSTREAM ISSUER's
//     policy. `binding.minimum_receipt_ttl_ms` is validated here only as a
//     positive integer, because r7 supplies no constraint on it at all — not an
//     absolute maximum, and not any relation to `maximum_member_receipt_ttl_ms`,
//     which is a policy over CONSUMED evidence and not over what this join
//     proposes. Inventing either would be a second TTL authority. The real bound
//     is the issuer's: M01 refuses a minimum receipt whose window exceeds its own
//     `binding.maximum_minimum_receipt_ttl_ms`, so the issuance adapter must
//     propose a TTL its own policy admits. This file states that obligation and
//     declines to guess its value.
//   * Building M01's `benchmark.deadline_contract` projection field in the HOURS
//     convention from the manifest's DAYS one. No code here performs that
//     conversion. The two REMAINING M01 divergences under THE M01 SEAM above are
//     value-domain checks at the seam, not conversions, and stay that way.
//   * The M01 projection's `binding.maximum_minimum_receipt_ttl_ms` is the
//     policy that must admit `binding.minimum_receipt_ttl_ms` proposed here.
//     They are two numbers under two authorities and this file still declines to
//     derive either from the other; the issuance adapter owns the reconciliation.
//   * AUTHENTICATING the benchmark coverage fact the join now requires. This
//     file re-derives the count and the SLO proof from the accepted payload, and
//     that is the whole of what a source kernel holding no measurements can
//     prove. Two obligations therefore remain, and the join refuses rather than
//     assuming either is met:
//       - A TRUSTED PRODUCER must compute the fact from the real measurement set
//         through `evaluateBenchmarkWorkloadCoverage` — `proposeBenchmarkCoverageFact`
//         does exactly that and nothing more. Its output is PROPOSED evidence.
//         Composing a fact is not authenticating one, and this module calls its
//         own output verified nowhere.
//       - A FUTURE STORAGE VERIFIER must, at the moment it puts the fact on the
//         authenticated projection, re-derive `measurement_set_digest` from the
//         stored measurement artifact and `evaluation_digest` from re-running
//         the same evaluator over it, and derive `evaluator_identity` from the
//         LIVE actor rather than reading it back out of a record — exactly as it
//         must for the Gate Zero outcome digest and for every member receipt.
//         No such verifier or store exists yet; until one does, no real coverage
//         fact can be authenticated, and this join admits nothing without one.
//   * Carrying the coverage binding ACROSS THE M01 SEAM. M01's `benchmark`
//     projection field set has no coverage slot, and consumer-gate-receipt.v1
//     has no field that could carry one, so the digests this join publishes are
//     for the issuance adapter and the durable store to persist beside the
//     receipt. Nothing here asserts that they reached the clock.

 *     or browser triple makes "which weight applies to this cell" unanswerable
 *     rather than merely redundant.
 *   evaluator_identities — a repeated evaluator seat is one evaluator counted
 *     twice, which inflates apparent independent review.
 *   request_size_distribution — this is the one derived rule that is NOT about
 *     the cell matrix, and it is the file's most over-constraining decision, so
 *     it is named as such. The list is a distribution WITHIN a cell: a mapping
 *     from percentile to bytes. Two entries for the same percentile make "how
 *     many bytes at p50" unanswerable, so a repeat is a malformed distribution
 *     rather than a redundant one. The consequence is stated plainly: a manifest
 *     a verified partner accepted with a repeated percentile IS denied here even
 *     though r7 would admit it, and the remedy is to change this rule, not to

//
//   A CELL is one (metric, subject, cache_state) triple crossed with the nine

//   bytes), not an axis of executions. comparator_versions and

//
//   The METRIC decides both the subject axis and the applicable fixed SLO, so a
//   threshold is never chosen by the caller:
//     core_navigation_ms        routes                    warm      2000 ms
//     lcp_ms                    routes                    cold      4000 ms
//     command_acknowledgement_ms acknowledgement_endpoints every      300 ms
//
// Workload weights govern representative coverage and cost reporting only. They
// are read to enumerate the workload axis and are never applied to a threshold;
// `weights_applied_to_thresholds: false` is on the result because that is the
// property the rule actually settles.

// purpose, because a fact that looked proved would be worse than none:
//
//   RE-DERIVED HERE, from the accepted payload alone. The required cell count is
//   recomputed by `benchmarkRequiredCells` — the same enumeration the evaluator
//   uses, not a second one — and the fact's counts must equal it. The complete
//   set of SLO keys must be present, each entry's cell must be a cell the
//   accepted matrix actually requires, its metric must be the one that owns that
//   threshold, and its p95 must be at or under the fixed threshold. So the two
//   outcome booleans cannot carry themselves: `all_required_cells_meet_slo: true`
//   beside a worst p95 over its threshold refuses, and `coverage_complete: true`
//   beside the wrong count refuses.
//
//   BOUND, NOT PROVED. `measurement_set_digest` and `evaluation_digest` name the
//   raw measurement set and the evaluator result they came from. This file holds
//   neither, so it checks their FORM and their presence and nothing else. The
