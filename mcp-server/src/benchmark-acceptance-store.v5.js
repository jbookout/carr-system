// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A00: durable benchmark-manifest persistence and the
// exact-hash human acceptance rail.
//
// benchmark-minimum.v5.js is pure. It can compute the ONE payload digest a
// verified partner would have to accept, and it can authenticate an acceptance
// envelope that already exists, but it cannot store a manifest and it cannot
// accept one — it says so itself, twice, under WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK.
// This file is the durable half: the benchmark subject decomposed into typed
// rows, an independent review bound to exact bytes and to the exact measurement
// evidence that was read, and a verified-partner acceptance whose acceptor is
// derived from the authenticated session.
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND PROJECTION LAYER, AND NOT A SECOND CONTRACT. Every rule
// about what a benchmark payload IS comes from benchmark-minimum.v5.js:
// validateBenchmarkPayload, benchmarkPayloadDigest and
// evaluateBenchmarkWorkloadCoverage are imported and called, never restated.
// The field list, the domain tag, the gate id, the producer role and the
// combiner are imported constants. Nothing here re-decides a benchmark rule; if
// this file and the kernel could disagree, one of them would be wrong.
//
// THE ROWS ARE THE RECORD. `benchmarkDraftRows` decomposes the twenty-six r7
// payload fields into ordered typed rows, and `benchmarkPayloadFromRows` puts
// them back. The round trip is exact — the rebuilt payload hashes to the same
// digest as the original — which is what makes ops/benchmark-acceptance.candidate.sql's
// recomputation of the digest FROM THE STORED ROWS a statement about the
// persisted manifest rather than about a blob a caller once supplied.
//
// THREE FIXED CONSTANT GROUPS ARE NOT STORED. slo_thresholds,
// cost_variance_thresholds and deadline_contract are identity, not
// configuration: r7 declares every field of all three `const`. They are
// re-emitted from the kernel's frozen tables when a payload is rebuilt, so no
// caller-chosen threshold can ever reach a digest, and a draft that disagrees
// with them is refused by validateBenchmarkPayload before it reaches storage.
//
// NO ACTOR ARRIVES IN A PAYLOAD, AND NO BOOLEAN GRANTS ANYTHING.
// benchmark-manifest.v1's four acceptance-envelope fields
// (benchmark_manifest_digest, accepted_by_identity, accepted_at, status) are
// excluded from the payload by the canonicalization contract and are recorded
// by the gateway from a verified human act. A draft carrying any of them is
// refused by name, and so is any argument whose key reads like a self-asserted
// verification. The acceptor's authority class is DERIVED at the moment of the
// act by identity.js's authorizationClassForActor over the LIVE actor, exactly
// as global-boundaries.v5.js does, and is never read back out of a stored row —
// a projection that copied a stored class string would turn the partner test
// into the caller boolean this rail exists to prevent.
//
// THE ACCEPTANCE VERB'S THREE BINDINGS ARE NOW ALL BOUND, AND IT STILL REFUSES
// UNLESS EACH OF THEM ANSWERS. r7's receipt_producer_step_registry makes the
// benchmark acceptance step depend on exactly two steps; acceptance additionally
// rests on the passing review's measurement evidence. Both of the two gaps this
// header used to name are closed — the coverage attestation on its own evidence,
// and Gate Zero in migration 0502 — and closing them changed WHY an acceptance
// refuses, not WHETHER it can. Every acceptance still fails closed unless a
// current passing Gate Zero outcome, an attested passing review on the same
// bytes and an accepted intact portfolio all answer, strictly before it, for a
// live verified partner.
//
//   * step:portfolio-constitution-human-exact-hash-acceptance-receipt — BOUND.
//     ops.portfolio_accepted_revision() from migration 0496 answers it,
//     recomputing every digest from the persisted rows and refusing an
//     integrity failure. Acceptance binds that revision. No accepted portfolio
//     is invented here, and acceptance refuses when none exists.
//     WHAT THAT BINDING PROVES, EXACTLY: portfolio_ref is a reference the
//     ACCEPTOR supplies, so the receipt records that the NAMED portfolio
//     constitution is accepted and intact — not that this benchmark descends
//     from it. No benchmark-to-portfolio lineage is recorded anywhere in the
//     record layer, so none is claimed, and none is invented here. r7 requires
//     the prerequisite step, not a lineage relation.
//   * step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome — BOUND as of migration 0502, and the
//     OLD READING IS RETIRED BY THE PACKET RATHER THAN BY PREFERENCE. This
//     bullet used to say r7 registers no v5 producer for the step and that it
//     runs outside this system. The card-10 amendment (decision
//     311a9af5-3685-4c47-a158-f8dd70870ca1) added the producer row with the role
//     independent_control_plane_oracle, and tools/doctorcre-v5-review.cjs's own
//     comment now says the external boundary moved down to the four
//     predecessors. The seat that holds the oracle — the independent Codex
//     reviewer lane — records the outcome itself under Joe's 2026-09-13 ruling
//     d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-9f1a-2b3c4d5e6f70, with no partner countersign.
//     `readGateZeroOutcome` below is STILL PRIVATE and still fail-closed: not
//     exported, and refusing whenever no current passing, unexpired outcome
//     exists. It takes a CONNECTION now rather than nothing, because it reads a
//     record; that is the whole of the change to its shape. It is still read
//     FIRST, so nothing on the acceptance path writes anything before it
//     answers.
//   * the review's MEASUREMENT COVERAGE — BOUND, AND STILL SEPARATE FROM GATE
//     ZERO ON PURPOSE. This verb's own review path proves coverage with the
//     kernel against the payload rebuilt from the stored rows and computes the
//     measurement digest itself. It now RECORDS what proved it, in the same
//     definer call that writes the review: the evaluator by name from a closed
//     source constant, the payload digest the evaluator returned, the
//     measurement digest it proved over, and the digest of the evaluation. A
//     passing review cannot be written without one, by any writer, so the
//     "asserted or proved, and nothing tells them apart" ambiguity is retired —
//     not by promoting the digest, but by making the pass unwritable without an
//     attributed statement of what proved it.
//     `readMeasurementCoverageBinding` is a real read of that record. It refuses
//     a missing attestation, an evaluator outside the closed set, an attested
//     payload digest the draft no longer produces, and an attested measurement
//     digest that is not the review row's. It is still private, and it is still
//     read AFTER Gate Zero, so landing Gate Zero cannot skip it.
//
// THE REMAINING TRUST BOUNDARY, STATED EXACTLY, AND UNCHANGED BY THE
// ATTESTATION LANDING. The samples never enter the record layer. Now that the
// review path records an attestation naming the kernel evaluator, the payload
// digest it proved against and the measurement digest it proved over, the record
// layer is STILL believing a TRUSTED WRITER about an evaluation it did not
// perform and cannot repeat. The attestation makes that belief explicit,
// attributed and auditable, and it makes an unattested pass unwritable; it does
// not make the database a verifier of coverage, and no comment here should be
// read that way. Two of the three attested values — the payload digest and the
// measurement digest — the database does check for itself. The third, that the
// named evaluator is what ran, it takes on the writer's word.
//
// Both integration requirements are stated in full in the two frozen constants
// below and repeated in the refusal details, so each is named — the one still
// unbound and the one resolved — at the point where someone hits it. Every acceptance is additionally required to be
// strictly after both prerequisites — an acceptance AT a prerequisite instant
// did not follow it, which is the same exclusive reading
// benchmark-minimum.v5.js applies to member observation.
//
// WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK, named rather than implied:
//   * NO LONGER OUTSTANDING: the authenticated Gate Zero outcome record and its
//     two readers. Migration 0502 lands the record;
//     ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome() and readGateZeroOutcome below were
//     implemented in the SAME change, which is what the requirement demanded —
//     deleting the throw in one of them alone would have opened the gate without
//     a record. mcp-server/test/benchmark-acceptance-store.v5.test.mjs keeps that
//     pairing enforced now that neither throws: it reads both sources and fails
//     if either one reverts to a raise while the other still reads.
//   * NO LONGER OUTSTANDING: the measurement coverage attestation. It is
//     recorded by the review write path and read by both readers, landed
//     together in one change as the requirement demanded. What it does NOT
//     resolve is the authenticated benchmark_coverage fact the join projection
//     needs — that one requires a LIVE declared evaluator seat and a storage
//     verifier that re-derives the evaluation, and it is a different obligation
//     for a different artifact. See benchmark-minimum.v5.js's own statement of
//     it; nothing here should be read as having supplied it.
//   * Applying ops/benchmark-acceptance.candidate.sql as a numbered migration.
//     It is candidate source and is not in public.schema_migrations.
//   * Registering these verbs. `benchmarkAcceptanceStoreTools` is exported and
//     is deliberately NOT added to any tool index by this slice: registering a
//     humanOnly/authorityOnly verb is a separate, reviewed act.
//   * Projecting an r7 acceptance envelope. Three of its four fields are
//     available from an acceptance receipt, but accepted_by_identity is an
//     authenticated-receipt-identity.v1 and the actor object this rail sees
//     carries no `session:` reference. Minting one would be inventing the
//     binding the envelope exists to record, so no envelope is projected here.

 * This is still not a Gate Zero policy, it still grants nothing, and nothing

 *
 * ONE OF THE OLD `why_unresolved` CLAUSES WAS ALSO WRONG BY THE TIME IT WAS
 * REPLACED, and it is kept below under `corrected_stale_clause` rather than
 * silently dropped. It said `step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome` is an external
 * pre-v5 step for which r7 registers no v5 producer, and that this is
 * intentional. The card-10 amendment (decision
 * 311a9af5-3685-4c47-a158-f8dd70870ca1, applied under Joe's ruling on open loop
 * #589) added the producer row, and tools/doctorcre-v5-review.cjs's own comment
 * now says the external boundary moved down to the four predecessors. That
 * sentence was the single most likely thing to send the next reader looking for
 * a human, so it is corrected by name.
