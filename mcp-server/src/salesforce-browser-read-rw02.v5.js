// DoctorCRE v5 V5-RW02 — the browser-only Salesforce READ adapter and the
// day-to-day reconciliation pass, READ-ONLY toward Salesforce.
//
// THE RULINGS THIS FILE ENCODES, read fresh from the record layer:
//
//   c04ac197  Dell's Salesforce is the primary source. A deal there without Joe
//             on it becomes an action to get Joe added, never a silent skip.
//   c0014a37  No continuous field sync. Day to day, reconciliation checks only
//             deal PRESENCE and PARTNER MEMBERSHIP. Field values are a
//             pre-invoice step, and that step is not in this file. A row that
//             arrives carrying a field value is a POLICY CONFLICT and stops.
//   493de438  A kind of update turns autonomous only after 5 CONSECUTIVE clean
//             attended runs of that kind; any unclean run resets the count.
//             Every run's outcome is recorded server-side
//             (record-salesforce-run-outcome); nothing here promotes a kind.
//   9b2e2011  Browser only. No API, connector or MCP route to Salesforce.
//   9ea10e5b  Sign-in: the system never types, reads, copies, logs or stores a
//   4e1efae4  password or a code. It MAY press Log in on credentials the
//             browser autofilled, and for a sign-in IT started it MAY click the
//             code field or the From-Messages suggestion so macOS fills the
//             code, at most 3 attempts. Any other challenge stops the run.
//   bf194d7d  Dell's consent to these reads, relayed by Joe. Dell's accounts
//             need Dell's own OK: a run is allowed only while THAT decision
//             record exists, is a partner's record with the partner's literal
//             words, and has not been revoked (revoke-salesforce-read-consent).
//
// SAFE STOPS ARE TYPED (checkable_done 1). Every stop the run can reach
// returns `answer_kind: "rw02-safe-stop.v1"` with a registered `stop_class`
// (V5_RW02_SAFE_STOP_CLASSES), a registered `reason_id`, a plain-language
// `message`, `partial_writes: 0` and `findings_recorded: 0`. The only records
// a stop leaves are its own receipts: the kernel page stop, when the kernel
// ladder is what stopped, and the run's unclean outcome. A stop never files a
// finding, because a finding from part of a list is a guess.
//
// NO PARTIAL WRITES. Findings are PLANNED in full, every planned write is
// checked (recipient, scope, credential shape), and only then is the first one
// sent. A check that fails on the last planned finding stops the run before
// the first finding is written.
//
// READ MODE IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A FLAG. The runner reaches the browser only
// through readOnlyReader() (observe, nextPage) and, for sign-in only, through
// signInOperator() (the Log in press and the four code-step clicks). Both are
// frozen null-prototype facades that forward no arguments. It writes to the
// record layer only through readModeRecorder(), which admits four named verbs.
//
// IDENTITY AND TIME ARE NOT ARGUMENTS. The org, seat, Joe's Salesforce user ref
// and the expected UI fingerprint come from a server-side binding source; the
// consent comes from the decision record; a sign-in ticket's time comes from
// the database clock, read at the moment Log in is pressed. A caller-supplied
// time, consent flag, partner, org or capability is refused.
//
// REPEAT RUNS ARE REPLAYS; REOPENED LOOPS ARE NEW. Every finding is keyed on
// org + opportunity (or deal + reason) and carries no run-specific text, so a
// repeat run replays. A loop filed for a finding and since CLOSED, whose
// finding is true again, is filed under the next episode key: a new action.
