// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J102: the persistence tail for the CRE lifecycle.
//
// The pure kernel in cre-lifecycle.v5.js decides. This module is what makes
// those decisions RECORDS: it loads the stored subjects and the stored evidence,
// derives the actor and the instant from the server, runs the kernel unchanged,
// and hands the exact canonical preimages to the security-definer functions in
// ops/cre-lifecycle.candidate.sql that own the compare-and-swap, the append-only
// history and the evidence recheck under lock.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, because it is the whole design:
//
//   KERNEL      Judges. Owns the vocabulary, the transition table, the refusal
//               matrix and the exact coupled facts. Unchanged and unwrapped:
//               this module imports it and reimplements none of it.
//   THIS MODULE Derives and loads. Resolves every caller REFERENCE into a
//               server-loaded record, takes the actor from the authenticated
//               transaction context and the instant from the server, refuses
//               caller authority and asserted-fact injection before any write,
//               and builds the envelopes.
//   DATABASE    Enforces. Recomputes every digest from committed bytes, refuses
//               a stale subject digest, RE-READS the exact evidence under the
//               lock it already holds and binds it to the subject the transition
//               advances, admits the transition against its own transcription of
//               the kernel's actor, subject and field contracts, refuses direct
//               DML, and returns the readback.
//
// WHY THE DATABASE RESTATES SOME OF THE KERNEL'S CONTRACT AT ALL. Everything this
// module checks it checks in JavaScript, and ops.j102_apply_transition is granted
// to carr_writer as well as carr_authority — so `authorityOnly` here and
// `permitted_actor_classes` in the kernel are controls on THIS caller and on
// nothing else. ops.j102_admission_policy() in the candidate SQL therefore
// carries the same contracts, and the parity tests in this slice's suite assert
// the two are equal contract by contract. That is a transcription with a
// comparison, not a second opinion: nothing in the SQL map decides anything the
// kernel does not already decide, and the day it drifts the suite fails.
//
// A CALLER SUPPLIES REFERENCES, NEVER FACTS. Every write operation below takes
// ids, digests and a small closed set of declared choices. It cannot supply a
// tenant, an actor, a clock, a subject, an evidence record, a document state, a
// decision or a digest of anything this module computes; the derived-field guard
// refuses each of those BY NAME, so the refusal says what was attempted rather
// than reporting a generic unknown field.
//
// WHICH SCHEMA THIS MODULE REQUIRES, said plainly. It calls ops.j102_* from
// ops/cre-lifecycle.candidate.sql — including ops.j102_initialize_subject, the
// separate narrow writer the three initialization operations use — which is an
// UNNUMBERED CANDIDATE and is not applied anywhere by this slice. It also calls four functions that arrive with
// domain.sql — ops.f01_principal, ops.f01_now_text, ops.f01_read and
// ops.f01_stored_artifact — and it calls them rather than restating them,
// because the authenticated principal, the server clock and the document and
// artifact readbacks each have exactly one home and this is not it. Against a
// database carrying neither hunk every operation fails on a missing function,
// which is loud and closed.
//
// TWO EVIDENCE READERS DO NOT EXIST, AND THE PATHS THAT NEED THEM FAIL CLOSED.
// See V5_J102_ABSENT_EVIDENCE_READERS below: nothing in this record layer
// authenticates a representation-equivalence approval or a multi-target
// exception approval, because nothing PRODUCES one. Those two paths refuse with
// the missing fact named. They are not stubbed, defaulted, or satisfied from a
// caller field, and landing a producer for one does not silently open the other.
//
// THE THREE INITIALIZATION OPERATIONS ARE WIRED, AND THEY ARE NOT A BYPASS.
// `initialize-prospect-relationship`, `initialize-assignment` and
// `initialize-property-negotiation` create the FIRST row of a chain — the one
// thing no transition may do, because a transition's own prerequisites need a
// committed row to be checked against. They run through their own writer
// (ops.j102_initialize_subject) against their own admission map, they create only
// the earliest declared state of their kind, and ops.j102_apply_transition still
// refuses a proposed primary subject by name. Every transition prerequisite,
// every evidence contract and every subject binding is exactly as it was.
//
// Q103'S TWO CALLERS ARE WIRED AT SOURCE. `record-lifecycle-reconciliation`
// evaluates one concurrent edit against the version the caller decided against
// and the version the DATABASE holds, and appends a visible unresolved item
// through ops.j102_record_reconciliation_item; the `ownership_and_freshness` read
// kind composes two EXISTING SQL reads and projects what they establish. Both are
// described in V5_J102_WIRED_CONCURRENCY_CAPABILITIES with their exact residuals.
//
// WHAT REMAINS UNWIRED IS NOW TWO FACTS RATHER THAN TWO CALLERS. No relation in
// this record layer records WHO OWNS a subject or WHAT AUTOMATION IS RUNNING
// against it, so the projection reports both as UNKNOWN — which is the answer the
// kernel was built to distinguish from "none" — and V5_J102_UNWIRED_CAPABILITIES
// names each with the exact minimal change that would produce it. Neither is
// stubbed, defaulted, or answered from a caller.
//
// WIRED AT SOURCE IS NOT REGISTERED AT RUNTIME, and this module makes only the
// first claim. It touches no tools.js, no mutation registry and no generated
// catalog; v5J102ToolRegistrations() is a DESCRIPTION and every entry still
// carries its four false flags. Nothing here claims an executed end-to-end run:
// the Node suite exercises these paths against a scripted handle, and the SQL
// fixture remains unexecuted.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It registers nothing: v5J102ToolRegistrations() below
// is a DESCRIPTION the parent may register from, and this file does not touch
// tools.js, mcp.js, the mutation registry or any generated catalog. It performs
// no provider call, calls no Salesforce API, sends nothing, and completes no
// acceptance.

//
//   AUTHORITY INJECTION — a field purporting to confer authority. Reused from
//     the kernel by IMPORT rather than copied, so the two lists cannot drift.
//   ASSERTED-FACT INJECTION — a field stating the outcome the transition exists
//     to establish. Also imported.
//   DERIVED-VALUE INJECTION — a field the SERVER owns: the tenant, the instant,
//     the loaded subject, the loaded evidence, the evaluated decision, a digest
//     of something this module computes. These are not authority claims and not
//     outcome claims, so neither kernel list names them, but a caller supplying
//     one would be choosing the evidence its own write is judged against. That
//     is the same failure wearing different clothes.
//
// A DIGEST IS NOT ALWAYS AN INJECTION, and the difference matters. A caller may
// name `expected_state_digest` to state the version it decided against, and may
// name `expected_content_digest` to pin the document version it means. Both are
// CHECKED against a readback or a recomputation and never trusted: a pin that
// does not match refuses. Everything else in the derived list is refused by name.

/**
 * One visible reconciliation item, as the relation must receive it.
 *
 * IT IS FLAT, AND THAT IS THE RELATION'S SHAPE RATHER THAN A CHOICE. Every other
 * stored record in this module nests the kernel's answer under its own schema
 * version; ops.j102_reconciliation_item instead reads `conflict_kind`,
 * `base_version_digest`, `current_version_digest`, `subject_kind`, `subject_id`
 * and `proposed_by` off the TOP LEVEL, and CHECK-binds `incoming_edits`,
 * `concurrent_edits` and `resolved_by_machine` there too. So the kernel's item
 * fields are carried BYTE FOR BYTE at the top level — including its own
 * schema_version, which is accurate: this is that item — and this module adds
 * exactly two kinds of key beside them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS, AND WHY EACH IS THE STORE'S FACT AND NOT THE KERNEL'S:
 *
 *   THE SUBJECT. evaluateConcurrentEdit is never told which record it is judging;
 *   it compares two digests and two edit sets. Which subject those belong to is
 *   the store's own validated reference, and the relation requires it — an item
 *   that cannot say what it is about is not visible in any useful sense.
 *
 *   THE OTHER SIDE'S EVIDENCE. The kernel preserves both edit sets, and on the
 *   uncharacterized branch the concurrent set is genuinely empty — this layer can
 *   prove the subject MOVED and cannot enumerate whose field went where. What it
 *   CAN show is authoritative and is shown instead of guessed: the committed
 *   state as it stands now, and the tail of the append-only history that produced
 *   it, each row naming its transition, its actor and its instant. A person
 *   resolving this has the two versions and the changes between them.

  /**
   * Q103's visible reconciliation, end to end at the record layer.
   *
   * ORDERED, and every step names whose fact it is:
   *   1. Authenticate, validate the closed payload. An edit names a FIELD and a
   *      VALUE DIGEST; who made it and when are derived, and its CLASS is the
   *      kernel's to decide from its own registry.
   *   2. Open the transaction and take the actor and the instant from the SERVER.
   *   3. Load the subject through the verified read door. THE CURRENT VERSION
   *      DIGEST IS THE STORED ONE — a caller supplying it would be choosing the
   *      version its own edit is judged against, which is the whole question.
   *   4. Run the KERNEL. It decides; nothing here second-guesses it, and nothing
   *      here merges.
   *   5. On `allow` there is nothing to reconcile and nothing is written.
   *   6. On `reconcile`, gather the authoritative evidence of the other side —
   *      the committed state and the tail of the history that produced it — and
   *      append ONE visible item through ops.j102_record_reconciliation_item.
   *
   * WHAT THIS PATH DOES NOT DO, and each is a fact rather than an omission:
   *
   *   IT NEVER SUPPLIES A CONCURRENT EDIT SET. A caller's account of what the
   *   other partner changed is precisely the thing that cannot be trusted, and
   *   this layer cannot derive one: ops.j102_subject exposes no prior_state_digest
   *   to anchor a diff to. So the kernel is told nothing about it and takes its
   *   own `concurrent_change_not_characterized` branch, which reconciles visibly
   *   rather than merging on an absence. The item records that it is
   *   uncharacterized; it does not imply the other side made no edits.
   *
   *   IT AUTO-MERGES NOTHING, and cannot. The kernel's merge branch needs a
   *   demonstrably non-overlapping, POLICY-CLASSIFIED, entirely routine edit set,
   *   and it is unreachable twice over here: no concurrent set is supplied, and
   *   the field-class registry registers no routine field at all.
   *
   *   IT DOES NOT DEDUPLICATE BY READING FIRST. An earlier revision looked for an
   *   open item with the same subject, versions and conflict kind and returned it
   *   instead of writing. That could not be a correctness claim: it was not
   *   atomic, two callers passed it at the same instant, and it could not tell a
   *   stale reading from a current one. Duplication is settled where it can be —
   *   under the idempotency key, inside the writer — and the property that
   *   survives is narrower and true: a RETRY of the same request replays, and two
   *   DIFFERENT proposals against the same two versions are two real conflicts
   *   and both stay visible.
   *
   *   AND IT CLAIMS NOTHING THE WRITER ENFORCES. The staleness bindings are the
   *   writer's, under its own lock, at commit time: this layer sends the operand
   *   it read and the evidence it gathered, and the receipt reports what the
   *   database bound rather than what this function hoped.
