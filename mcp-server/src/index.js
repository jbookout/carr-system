// CARR MCP server — Worker entrypoint.
//
// The Worker's fetch IS an OAuthProvider (Cloudflare's workers-oauth-provider).
// It is the OAuth 2.1 authorization server to the Claude apps, and it wraps the
// MCP verb surface at /mcp as its protected API route. Everything else — the
// dead-man probe, the ingest socket, and the Google sign-in leg — goes to the
// default handler and is NOT behind an access token.
//
//   /mcp        API route for humans: a provider-issued OAuth token, validated
//               by the provider, with the actor arriving as ctx.props. The
//               legacy PARTNER_TOKENS bearer that used to share this route was
//               retired 2026-08-03 (#111b).
//               A SECOND, much narrower door onto the same route was added
//               2026-08-06 (loop #192), for the smoke suite only: a
//               PROBE_TOKENS bearer, checked in THIS file BEFORE the request
//               ever reaches the OAuthProvider (see "probe token" below). It
//               maps to one locked-profile machine actor, never a human, and
//               its profile can never be widened by the request — the OAuth
//               path above is otherwise completely untouched.
//               A THIRD, equally narrow door was added the same day for the
//               Automatic Review Council's Codex lane (see "review token"
//               below): a REVIEW_TOKENS bearer, checked immediately after the
//               probe-token check and on the exact same before-the-provider
//               pattern. It maps a reviewer slug (e.g. 'codex-reviewer') to
//               the 'reviewer' capability profile locked in mcp.js: ALL reads
//               + EXACTLY record-finding. Nothing about the OAuth path or the
//               probe-token path changes because it exists.
//               A FOURTH door (see "local token" below), Phase 1 2026-08-13,
//               decision 97e76a2f: a LOCAL_TOKENS bearer for this Mac's own
//               `run.sh call` terminal (tools/call-verb.py ->
//               mcp-server/local-verb.mjs), which used to bypass this Worker
//               with a direct database connection. Resolves to the machine's
//               own actor: 'joe-local' sponsored to 'joe', or 'dell-local'
//               sponsored to 'dell'. Both are human:false — full verb parity
//               minus humanOnly, same as the agent-token door, never a wider
//               grant than that.
//   /pipeline/changes  OAuth-protected Deal Room event cursor + live presence.
//   /authorize  Google sign-in starts (our code — see google-oidc.js)
//   /callback   Google returns; identity verified; allow-list applied; issue
//   /token      implemented by the provider
//   /register   implemented by the provider (RFC 7591 dynamic client registration)
//   /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server        provider (RFC 8414)
//   /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource[/path]   provider (RFC 9728)
//   /health     unchanged, unauthenticated dead-man probe
//   /release    unauthenticated, added Phase 1 2026-08-13 (deploy-provenance
//               gap): what code this deploy is running — Git SHA (stamped at
//               deploy time, see release.js), the schema_migrations ledger's
//               claim, doctrine generation, live verb count. No secret in
//               the response, same posture as /health.
//   /ingest     unchanged, INGEST_TOKENS bearer — deliberately OUTSIDE the OAuth wrap
//   /capture/*  capture rig bridge, CAPTURE_TOKENS claim then opaque session token
//
// NO SEND CAPABILITY EXISTS OR WILL EXIST IN THIS WORKER.
//
// CORRELATION (Program 3, Gap A, 2026-08-14). Every route above — every one —
// flows through the single default export at the bottom of this file, so that
// is where wrapWithCorrelation (correlation.js) wraps once: it resolves
// x-correlation-id (a caller's own valid UUID is echoed back verbatim; a
// missing or garbage one is replaced with a fresh one, never passed through),
// sets env.CORRELATION_ID for anything downstream to read, echoes the id back
// as x-correlation-id on every response, and turns an uncaught throw into a
// structured log line plus a 500 whose body carries the id — see
// correlation.js's own header for the full reasoning.
//
// TRACING THE FAILURE (Program 4, Gap A2, 2026-08-14, defect cae5be2e).
// correlation.js stays exactly what its own header says it is — no database
// driver, no ops.* write, Node-testable on its own. The database half lives in
// trace.js's withFailureRecording, composed HERE, one layer inside
// wrapWithCorrelation: `wrapWithCorrelation(withFailureRecording(routeRequest))`.
// That ordering matters — wrapWithCorrelation sets env.CORRELATION_ID BEFORE
// calling its handler argument, so by the time withFailureRecording runs, the
// id it needs is already there. It records exactly two of the three classes
// trace.js's header defines (any HTTP 5xx this Worker returns, and an
// uncaught throw before it becomes wrapWithCorrelation's own 500) by wrapping
// routeRequest's call and checking the response status; the third class
// (mcpApiHandler's/protectedApiHandler's own actor-unresolved 401) is recorded
// at its own call site below, since a 401 is invisible to a >=500 check.

// A narrow, locked-profile machine identity for the smoke suite, re-credited

// it. Modeled directly on the INGEST_TOKENS check in ingest() above: same
// shape (a JSON map of name -> secret, one Worker secret, replaced whole),
// same lookup style. The differences are deliberate and narrow the blast
// radius further than a second INGEST_TOKENS-style socket would:
//
//   - PROBE_TOKENS authenticates ONLY /mcp, and only a request whose bearer
//     matches. Checked in the wrapper below, BEFORE the request ever reaches
//     the OAuthProvider, so it is never confused with a provider-issued
//     grant, and the whole OAuth path is untouched for every other request —
//     including a /mcp request whose bearer does NOT match PROBE_TOKENS,
//     which falls straight through to oauthProvider.fetch exactly as before.
//   - The matched map key becomes the actor slug. Exactly one is expected to
//     exist — 'smoke-probe' — but the map shape leaves room for a second
//     narrow probe identity later without another code change.
//   - actor.probe = true is the ONLY thing that can put mcp.js's dispatch()
//     into the 'probe' capability profile (see the check there). ?profile=
//     is read for every other caller but is IGNORED here on purpose: the
//     whole point of this token is that it cannot be asked for more than it
//     was provisioned for, no matter what the request says.
//   - human: false, always. A probe actor is a machine and is never eligible
//     for a humanOnly verb (teach, retire-rule, confirm-merge, reassign-deal,
//     …), independent of whatever verbs the profile Set does or does not name.
//   - The actor must exist as a row in `actor` (kind='automation') before any
//     write verb will run — mcp.js's callTool() looks it up by slug inside the
//     write transaction and refuses actor_not_provisioned if it is missing,
//     exactly as it does for every other actor. See
//     pipelines/provision-smoke-probe.sql (prepared, not yet run).
//
// NOT a rebuild of the retired PARTNER_TOKENS bearer: that token authenticated
// as a full human actor (joe or dell) on the full profile. This token
// authenticates as its own machine actor, locked to three write verbs, and

// shape (a JSON map of slug -> secret, one Worker secret, replaced whole),
// same lookup style, same "checked before the OAuthProvider ever sees the
// request" placement. The differences mirror why PROBE_TOKENS exists as its
// own thing rather than widening INGEST_TOKENS or PARTNER_TOKENS:
//
//   - REVIEW_TOKENS authenticates ONLY /mcp, and only a request whose bearer
//     matches. A /mcp request whose bearer matches neither PROBE_TOKENS nor
//     REVIEW_TOKENS falls straight through to oauthProvider.fetch exactly as
//     before — this door adds nothing to that path.
//   - The matched map key becomes the actor slug. TWO are expected to hold a
//     live secret as of the 2026-08-06 scope extension: 'codex-reviewer'
//     (the original frozen scope) and 'grok-reviewer' (added the same day
//     once Grok's subscription-covered headless path — OAuth device flow,
//     no XAI_API_KEY — was live-verified; decision 65468572's Codex-only
//     cost override was superseded by that verification, not overridden by
//     assumption). Nothing in this file names either slug specially — this
//     code path is, and was designed to be, generic: adding a THIRD reviewer
//     later is a secret update and an actor row (pipelines/provision-review-
//     council.sql), never another code change here.
//   - actor.review = true is the ONLY thing that can put mcp.js's dispatch()
//     into the 'reviewer' capability profile (see the check there). ?profile=
//     is read for every other caller but is IGNORED here on purpose, exactly
//     like the probe path: the token cannot be asked for more than it was

//   - human: false, always. A reviewer actor is a machine and is never
//     eligible for a humanOnly verb, independent of whatever the profile Set
//     does or does not name.
//   - The actor must exist as a row in `actor` (kind='automation') before
//     record-finding — the ONE write this profile allows — will run; mcp.js's
//     callTool() looks it up by slug inside the write transaction and refuses
//     actor_not_provisioned if it is missing, exactly as it does for every
//     other actor. See pipelines/provision-review-council.sql. PROVISIONED

//     reviewer actor rows exist, active=t) — the refusal backstop below is
//     therefore already open; the profile lock is the operative control.

// ---------- hermes token (R0 runtime evaluation, 2026-08-16) ----------
//
// The fifth door, built on the PROBE_TOKENS/REVIEW_TOKENS pattern above and
// differing from them in exactly one way: its locked profile has an EMPTY
// write set. A Hermes runtime authenticated here reads everything and writes
// nothing, which is the 2026-08-12 frontier council's R0 disposition rendered
// as a server control rather than an instruction.
//
// WHY A FIFTH DOOR RATHER THAN REUSING AGENT_TOKENS. AGENT_TOKENS is the
// outside-model CLI door (codex, grok — loop #227/#239), and an actor arriving
// through it takes profileFor(request), so it can pass ?profile=capture and
// write. That is correct for a CLI a partner is driving turn by turn with a
// human reading every result. Hermes is not that: it is a persistent daemon
// with its own memory, scheduler and messaging channels, and its restraint is
// not a control. Widening AGENT_TOKENS to cover it would either hand Hermes
// the CLI's write path or take that path away from Codex and Grok. A separate
// secret, separate slug and separate lock keeps both true at once, and keeps
// `via` legible in tool_call rows.
//
// WHAT THIS DOOR IS NOT PROTECTING AGAINST. Not confidentiality. Joe closed
// that on 2026-08-12 ("the added exposure is minimal") and every frontier
// council seat, Grok included, has read entire CARR doctrines. The boundary is
// held credentials and autonomous authority (rule d7f74c93). The evidence it
// is warranted arrived the day Hermes was installed: within minutes it had
// seeded itself a Copilot credential off the gh CLI without being asked.
//
// The actor carries no sponsoring_human_slug, so identity.js resolves it to
// `unsponsored_agent` with shared-only scope and no personal brain — the R0
// fixture's cross-brain and unsponsored-metadata cases fall out of that
// existing rule rather than needing anything new here. humanOnly verbs refuse
// on human:false, as they do for every machine actor.
//
// Checked AFTER probeActorFor and reviewActorFor, matching their ordering
// reasoning: separate secrets never collide in practice, and a deterministic
// order is worth more than an equally arbitrary one.
// The lookup itself lives in identity.js (hermesActorForToken) for the same
// reason agentActorFor's does: this file imports from `cloudflare:` and cannot
// be loaded by node --test, so logic left in here is logic nothing can prove
// before a deploy. A boundary that can only be tested by deploying is not a
// boundary anyone should trust.

// ---------- agent tokens (outside-model CLIs at full scope, loop #227/#239) ----------
//
// WHY A THIRD DOOR. Codex reaches this Worker over OAuth and, since the loop
// #227 deploy, attributes correctly to its own actor (grant metadata reads
// "joe via codex"). Grok cannot: its CLI has no per-MCP-server login command,
// its headless path performs no dynamic client registration, and its TUI
// reports "not authenticated" against an OAuth server. Verified live
// 2026-08-09, three ways. There is no client_name to add to
// AGENT_CLIENT_NAMES because Grok never registers a client at all.
//
// So Grok authenticates the only way it can — `grok mcp add --header
// "Authorization: Bearer ..."` — and this map is the door that bearer opens.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is NOT a revival of PARTNER_TOKENS, retired 2026-08-03.
// That secret authenticated as a full HUMAN actor (joe or dell), which meant it
// carried the humanOnly verbs — teach, retire-rule, confirm-merge, new-deal,
// reassign-deal — on a credential sitting in a config file. This one resolves
// to the tool's OWN actor with human:false, so mcp.js's humanOnly gate refuses
// every one of those by construction, not by a list someone has to maintain.
// That is exactly the parity decision 5dd21310 asked for: every verb EXCEPT
// humanOnly.
//
// WHY NO PROFILE LOCK, unlike probe and reviewer. Those two exist to pin a
// narrow surface (probe: reads; reviewer: reads + record-finding) and they set
// actor.probe / actor.review precisely so ?profile= cannot widen them. An agent
// token is the opposite case: full parity IS the grant, so it takes
// profileFor(request) like any other caller. A session that wants to run itself
// narrower can still pass ?profile=capture; it can never run wider, because
// human:false is set here and nothing on the wire can change it.
//
// The slug must be a known actor (identity.js DISPLAY) AND must exist as an
// `actor` row before any write runs — mcp.js's callTool() refuses
// actor_not_provisioned otherwise, same as every other path. codex and grok
// were provisioned by migration 0074_outside_model_actors.
//
// Checked AFTER probe and reviewer so a token colliding across maps resolves
// to the narrowest door first. In practice a caller holds exactly one.
// The lookup itself lives in identity.js (agentActorForToken) so node --test can
// prove it: this file imports from `cloudflare:` and cannot be loaded outside the
// Worker runtime, so anything implemented here is unprovable before a deploy.

  return agentActorForToken(request.headers.get("authorization"), env.AGENT_TOKENS);

// ---------- local token (Phase 1, 2026-08-13, decision 97e76a2f) ----------
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `run.sh call <verb>` (tools/call-verb.py ->
// mcp-server/local-verb.mjs) used to open its OWN direct connection to the
// production database and run a verb's handler code locally — bypassing this
// Worker entirely, and with it the identity derivation above, the profile
// gate in mcp.js, and the read-call instrumentation (0108's tool_read_call).
// Proven live 2026-08-13: a standing-context call through that path left no
// tool_read_call row; the same verb through this door does. local-verb.mjs is
// now a thin HTTPS client of THIS Worker's /mcp endpoint, carrying the bearer
// below — every verb it calls runs through dispatch() exactly like any other
// caller on this page, with one exception (see NOT A REBUILT PARTNER_TOKENS).
//
// WHY A FOURTH DOOR RATHER THAN REUSING AGENT_TOKENS. `wrangler secret put`
// REPLACES a secret wholesale and no secret can be read back — widening
// AGENT_TOKENS for this would mean re-pasting Codex's and Grok's live tokens
// from memory, a silent-kill risk for both on a typo (secrets-inventory.md's
// INGEST_TOKENS_EXTRA note is the same lesson, hit once already). LOCAL_TOKENS
// is its own Worker secret, additive and structurally identical to
// PROBE_TOKENS / REVIEW_TOKENS / AGENT_TOKENS: a JSON map of slug -> secret,
// checked here before the OAuthProvider ever sees the request.
//
// THE ACTORS: 'joe-local' and 'dell-local', both human:false. Each machine
// holds only its own key. Unlike the outside-model CLIs above, each carries a
// server-derived sponsor: identity.js's LOCAL_SPONSOR map ties joe-local to
// Joe and dell-local to Dell, so personal-scope reads and writes land with the
// partner who owns that terminal. That resolution is entirely identity.js's
// job (agentActorForToken, extended rather than duplicated — see its own
// comment); nothing about it lives in this file.
//
// EVERY VERB EXCEPT humanOnly FALLS OUT OF EXISTING MECHANISMS, ON PURPOSE.
// No profile lock here (unlike probe/reviewer): full parity minus humanOnly
// IS the grant, exactly like the agent-token door above, because human:false
// makes tools.js's `if (tool.humanOnly && !actor.human) throw ...` refuse
// teach / retire-rule / confirm-merge / reassign-deal / new-deal / … by
// construction — never a list this file has to maintain. A credential sitting
// in a 600 file on a Mac must not be able to teach a rule that binds both
// partners, retire one, confirm a merge, or reassign a deal; if that is ever
// truly needed with no interactive session available, it is a deliberate,
// receipted break-glass act (mcp-server/local-verb.mjs), never this door.
//
// NOT A REBUILT PARTNER_TOKENS (retired 2026-08-03, see the note above
// agentActorForToken in identity.js): that secret authenticated as a full
// HUMAN actor, which is exactly what carried the humanOnly verbs on a
// credential in a config file. This one resolves to human:false with a
// server-derived sponsor, which is a different, narrower shape — sponsored
// but never human — and the humanOnly gate answers to `actor.human`, not to
// whether a sponsor exists.
//
// The machine's actor row (kind='automation') must exist before any write verb
// runs, exactly like every other machine actor above. Joe's runbook is
// pipelines/provision-local-client.sql; Dell's is
// pipelines/provision-dell-local-client.sql. The steps that touch either
// secret remain human-only, same division of labor as PROBE_TOKENS.
//
// Checked last among the token doors: probe and reviewer are the narrowest
// (a locked profile), agent and local are both full-parity-minus-humanOnly,
// and a token colliding across maps resolves deterministically to whichever
// is checked first — in practice a caller holds exactly one.
