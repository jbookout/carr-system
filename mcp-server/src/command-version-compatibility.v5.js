// V5-F07 phase 1 — the four-axis command-version compatibility comparator.
//
// Q058.D1 settles that clients, workers and deployments report compatible CODE,
// SCHEMA, COMMAND-CONTRACT and POLICY versions, and that anything incompatible
// fails closed and stays visible. This file is that comparison and nothing else:
// a pure function from one typed client declaration plus one deployment
// observation to a frozen answer.
//
// ALL FOUR AXES ARE REQUIRED, ALWAYS. There is no enforced/deferred split and no
// caller-supplied axis list — `enforced_axes` is an unknown field, so a request
// that tries to name which axes count cannot be read at all. An axis that is
// undeclared, unobservable, mismatched, or observed in a non-current policy epoch
// blocks; only four KNOWN and MATCHING axes allow.
//
// WHAT IT COMPARES, AND WHY EXACTLY. Matching is exact on the digest, and on the
// label when both sides report one. A registry that keeps its version string
// while its digest changes is a different command contract; a migration number
// that stays put while the ledger hash moves is a different schema. Commit
// distance and caller-declared ancestry are not inputs — they are not "read and
// ignored", they are unreadable fields — so nothing can outvote a digest.
//
// WHERE POLICY COMES FROM. /release cannot answer the policy axis.
// `doctrine_generation` is a doctrine row counter, not a policy epoch, and
// reading it as one is exactly the "a signal that happens to correlate" mistake
// release.js was built to stop. So the deployment's policy axis is UNOBSERVABLE
// unless a trusted policy-epoch observation is supplied beside the payload, and
// its state is read through policy-epoch.js's own normalizer rather than a second
// implementation of those semantics. That observation must BIND every dimension
// the payload reports AND name its tenant — the one dimension /release cannot
// report, which is why the evidence has to supply it — and the scope it names
// travels with the axis, so an epoch belonging to another tenant is compared
// against the client rather than silently dropped.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. Not authentication, not admission, not dispatch. Every
// result carries authenticated:false, authorizes_command_dispatch:false and
// runtime_admission_granted:false, because a public JSON payload is evidence a
// reader may look at and never a credential. An `allow` here says the four
// reported versions match — it does not admit a caller to anything.
