// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A04: THE HIERARCHICAL COST LEDGER — reservation,
// cancellation, late liability, conversion and truthful actuals across a slice,
// its child program and its portfolio ancestors (decision Q142.D1).
//
// THE SETTLED SENTENCE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE, in full because every
// clause of it is a rule below:
//
//   Q142.D1 — "Record estimate, reservation, authorization ceiling, actual
//   incurred charge, late liability, and variance separately. Ceiling
//   compliance governs admission and reservation, never truthfully booking
//   incurred cost. Atomically convert matching reservation or liability to
//   actual without double counting; always post over-ceiling actuals through
//   every ancestor, mark the hierarchy overdrawn, deny new reservations, and
//   require incident, replan, or explicit authority amendment."
//
// WHAT THE MONEY IS. Nothing here pays anybody. The slice's effect class is
// internal financial accounting with no external payment, so a cost is an
// abstract integer UNIT, there is no currency field, no provider is called and
// no charge is settled. A "vendor reference" below is an EXTERNAL IDENTIFIER
// used to recognise the same charge arriving twice; it is not a payment
// instruction and this module has no way to act on one.
//
// SIX SEAMS, and they are why the file is shaped this way:
//
//   1. THE LOG IS THE TRUTH AND EVERY TOTAL IS DERIVED FROM IT. There is no
//      running balance anywhere. Ancestor figures are computed by rolling the
//      children up on every read, so "post the actual through every ancestor"
//      is a STRUCTURAL property rather than a bookkeeping step that could be
//      skipped on one path. A maintained counter can drift from its log; a
//      derived one cannot, and that is the whole reason conservation is
//      provable here rather than merely tested.
//
//   2. THE CEILING GOVERNS ADMISSION, NEVER TRUTH. `reserve` is the only
//      operation a ceiling can refuse. `postActual` and `recordLateLiability`
//      are append-only truth and are accepted ABOVE the ceiling, every time,
//      because a charge that was really incurred does not stop existing when it
//      is inconvenient. Refusing one would not save the money; it would only
//      lose the record of it. Over-ceiling truth is what marks the hierarchy
//      overdrawn, which is the actual consequence.
//
//   3. CONVERSION REPLACES EXACTLY ONCE, AND ATOMICALLY. Converting is not
//      "add an actual and hope someone releases the reservation": one call
//      appends BOTH entries or neither, under one conversion id, and the
//      reservation moves from open to closed in the same step. A second
//      conversion of the same reservation is a returned `reservation_not_open`,
//      not a second actual — which is precisely the double count Q142 names.
//
//   4. A RETRY IS NOT A SECOND OPERATION. Every call carries an `operation_id`.
//      A replay of one already applied returns the RECORDED outcome and the
//      ledger unchanged. A replay carrying the same id and different arguments
//      is not a retry at all and THROWS, so an id reused by accident cannot
//      quietly shadow a different intent.
//
//   5. A RACE IS SETTLED BY A CELL THAT OWNS THE LEDGER, NOT BY THE ORDER A
//      TEST HAPPENS TO CHOOSE AND NOT BY A CALLER CHECKING ITSELF. Every
//      ledger value has a VERSION — the number of distinct operations it has
//      applied — and a state digest. A concurrent writer computes its commit
//      against a NAMED base (`prepareCommit`) and then offers it to the CELL
//      that holds the ledger (`openLedgerCell`). The cell is the only thing
//      that can admit a commit: it admits one only while it is still standing
//      on that exact base, it REDERIVES the transition from its own value
//      rather than installing the one the proposal carries, and it replaces
//      its value in one synchronous step. Two commits computed from one base
//      therefore produce exactly one landing and one `version_conflict`, and
//      the loser must recompute against what actually committed — which is
//      where it meets the ceiling it would otherwise have talked its way past.
//      That is a property of the ledger, not of a serial permutation and not
//      of a well-behaved caller. What it still does not prove is stated on the
//      projection: both writers here share ONE cell in ONE process, and a
//      durable store would need a row lock or a serializable transaction to
//      supply the same single admission point across processes.
//
//   6. OVERDRAWN IS NOT NETTED AWAY BY A SIBLING. A node that breaches its own
//      ceiling marks every ancestor overdrawn, and a reservation is denied when
//      any node on its own ancestor chain is overdrawn. A sibling shares those
//      ancestors, so it is denied too — there is no path by which one slice's
//      unused headroom silently absorbs another's overage, which this slice's
//      excluded scope names as sibling netting.
//
// A REFUSAL IS AN ANSWER; A MALFORMED INPUT IS A THROW. "This reservation is no
// longer open" and "this would breach the portfolio ceiling" are facts about
// the ledger and are RETURNED, with the numbers behind them. "This node does
// not exist" and "this entry has an unknown key" are contract violations and
// THROW. The two are never mixed, matching V5-F04's kernels exactly.
//
// NO EFFECTS. No filesystem, no network, no database, no environment and no
// clock: every instant arrives on an argument. Nothing here survives the
// process; the durable half is named in the projection, not imitated.

/**
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SECTION EXISTS TO SOLVE, said plainly because the first
 * version of this module did not solve it and said so.
 *
 * The direct calls above — `reserve`, `convertReservationToActual` and the
 * rest — are a SINGLE-WRITER interface. Each takes a ledger value and returns
 * the next one, and a caller that has the current value is by construction the
 * only writer. Sequencing such calls proves the arithmetic, and it is all the
 * single-writer path ever needs.
 *
 * It proves nothing at all about two writers. Two callers who each READ the
 * same ledger value and then each call `reserve` both get an answer computed
 * against a ledger that no longer exists by the time the second one acts, and
 * nothing in the single-writer interface can tell the second one so. Both can
 * be told "accepted" for the same headroom. Applying the two calls in a chosen
 * ORDER hides this rather than fixing it, because the order is exactly the
 * thing a race does not have.
 *
 * So a commit here NAMES THE BASE IT WAS COMPUTED FROM and the ledger admits
 * it only from that base:
 *
 *   1. `prepareCommit(base, step)` computes the whole operation against `base`
 *      and hands back the result WITHOUT installing it — the outcome the
 *      caller would get, the ledger it would produce, and the version and
 *      state digest of the base it assumed.
 *   2. A cell opened by `openLedgerCell` OWNS the value, and `cell.commit(
 *      prepared)` is the only point at which anything is installed. The cell
 *      checks the proposal's base against the version and state digest it is
 *      actually holding, rederives the step itself rather than trusting the
 *      ledger it was handed, and replaces the held value exclusively — the
 *      read, the decision and the replacement are one synchronous step. A
 *      proposal computed against a base the cell has moved off is refused
 *      `version_conflict` naming both versions; a proposal whose rederived
 *      result does not match what it carries is refused
 *      `prepared_commit_mismatch`. There is no commit point that takes the
 *      current value as an argument, because a caller-supplied current value
 *      is not an admission point at all.
 *   3. `cell.recompute(prepared)` is the loser's only honest move: compute the
 *      same step again against what actually committed. The second answer can
 *      differ from the first — that is the point. A reservation that fitted
 *      the old headroom meets `ceiling_exceeded` against the new one; a
 *      conversion of a reservation somebody else just converted meets
 *      `reservation_not_open`.
 *
 * WHY BOTH A VERSION AND A DIGEST. The version alone cannot tell two different
 * ledgers of the same age apart, and a commit computed against one lineage must
 * never install onto another. The digest pins the exact state; the version is
 * what a human reads in the refusal.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. ONE cell in ONE process, holding one in-memory value: the
 * boundary is only as wide as that cell, and two writers are admitted against
 * each other only because they go through the same one. This is a real
 * admission boundary against a stale or a doctored proposal — the thing that
 * was missing — and it is not durable serialization. Two processes
 * against a stored ledger need a row lock or a serializable transaction to
 * supply this same single admission point, and that gap stays named on the
 * projection rather than quietly closed by this section.

 *   2. Every open and closed reservation partitions the reservation ids the log
 *      carries, and no reservation is released twice.
 *   3. Outstanding reservations summed over nodes equal the open reservations
 *      held on the ledger — the derived view and the index agree.
 *   4. The same for liabilities.
 *   5. Every rolled-up figure equals own plus the children's rolled-up figures,
 *      at every node and for every measure. Estimates are excluded from the
 *      accrual clauses below because an estimate is a restatement, not a sum,
 *      but they ARE included in this one: a parent's rolled-up estimate is
 *      genuinely the sum of its own current estimate and its children's.
 *   6. Every conversion id carries exactly two entries — one release and one

      "a durable cross-process serialization boundary: the compare-and-swap above is real — the ledger cell OWNS the current value, a commit names the version and state digest of the base it was computed from, the cell admits exactly one commit per base and rederives the transition from its own value rather than installing the one it was handed, so a caller holding a stale read or a doctored proposal is refused rather than quietly granted a second claim on one headroom — but both callers are still two holders of ONE cell inside ONE process; two processes against the durable store above need a row lock or a serializable transaction to supply the same single admission point, and no test in this repository can stand in for that",
