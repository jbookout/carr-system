// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J102: the healthcare CRE lifecycle — Prospect through
// Client/Engagement/Assignment/Deal — as one closed, versioned domain kernel.
//
// Thirteen settled decisions (Q069, Q072, Q077, Q078, Q079, Q080, Q081, Q082,
// Q083, Q094, Q095, Q096, Q103) are encoded here as typed transitions with
// declared prerequisites, evidence, permitted actors, side effects and
// reversibility. Canonicalization and hashing come from artifact-trust.js, the
// one server-held tenant from identity.js, and the no-effects marker from
// global-boundaries.v5.js; this file reimplements none of them.
//
// THE SETTLED REQUIREMENT CONTROLS, NOT THE RECOMMENDATION IT REPLACED. Four of
// the thirteen were MODIFIED by Joe against the assistant's original proposal,
// and in each case the older proposal is the tidier thing to implement.
// V5_J102_USER_CORRECTIONS below names all four, quotes the correction, and
// names the superseded recommendation, so a future reader who reaches for the
// neater rule can see it was already considered and overruled:
//
//   Q078 — an accepted LOI does NOT wait for a fully executed lease to become a
//          Deal. Selection AND commitment to the winning accepted lease LOI
//          creates a PENDING Deal in negotiation; lease signing then marks the
//          EXECUTED lease state. The "executed instruments only" rule is dead.
//   Q094 — a signed purchase contract is LEGALLY executed and BUSINESS pending.
//          It runs through due diligence and closes only on the actual final
//          closing date. Signing is not closing.
//   Q095 — multiple LOIs are normal and are RETAINED. One selected winning
//          property and one active lease-draft target, unless an explicitly
//          approved exception.
//   Q069 — a signed effective ETL (or an approved equivalent) creates the Client
//          AND the Engagement; Salesforce's early opportunity stays a separate
//          corporate case.
//
// WHAT IS CODE HERE AND WHAT MUST ARRIVE AS EVIDENCE:
//
//   IN CODE — the STRUCTURE the decisions settle. The four distinct entities,
//   the closed state vocabularies on each axis, the transition table, which
//   facts are coupled, which axes are orthogonal, and which refusals exist.
//   These are identity, not configuration.
//
//   AS SERVER-LOADED EVIDENCE — every fact about the world. Whether an
//   engagement letter is signed and effective, whether an LOI was accepted,
//   whether a lease was executed, whether a closing actually happened. This
//   module invents none of them and accepts none of them from a caller: an
//   evidence record must carry server provenance, and a caller-supplied
//   "signed: true" is refused by name rather than read.
//
// THE TWO DOORS, AND WHY THE SECOND ONE IS NARROW. A TRANSITION advances a
// subject that already exists, against its committed row. An INITIALIZATION
// creates the first row of a chain — a prospect relationship, an assignment under
// an already active engagement, a property negotiation under a still-open
// assignment — and it is a SEPARATE, deliberately narrow admission rather than a
// transition with its prerequisites switched off. It creates the earliest
// declared state of its kind and nothing later, it carries no evidence because no
// evidence in this rail can bind to a subject that does not yet exist, and it
// weakens no transition: the client status, the opened assignment, the submitted
// LOI and the pending Deal all still require their own evidence afterwards. See
// the INITIALIZATION section below for the whole of it.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, following S01 and F01 deliberately:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is returned — a frozen result whose `decision` is "allow",
//     "refuse" or "reconcile", with a stable `reason_id`. A refusal is an answer
//     the caller may record.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION throws V5J102Error. Unknown fields, unknown
//     vocabulary values, open schemas, accessor properties, unreadable
//     timestamps and caller-supplied authority or evidence fields are not policy
//     questions; the module cannot read the request at all, so it fails closed
//     rather than guessing which settled boundary was meant.
//
// THE ONE-AUTHORITY RULE. This module JUDGES and PROJECTS. It stores no state,
// no event, no receipt and no reference. Every function is pure: no filesystem,
// no network, no database, no provider, no scheduler, no environment and no
// clock. Every evaluation that depends on time takes `now` from its caller.
// `V5_NO_EFFECTS` rides on every result to say so in the record.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. It is not persistence, not a handler, not a Salesforce
// adapter and not an acceptance path. Tour activation is OUT OF SCOPE by
// settlement rather than by omission: Q072 and Q080 both moved active Tour
// behaviour into Journey 3 so Journey 1 cannot depend on it, and no transition
// below creates, activates or reads a Tour.

// The two caller guards.
//
// AUTHORITY INJECTION — a field purporting to confer authority. The list is
// F01's, restated here rather than imported, because this module is a PEER of
// F01 and not a client of it: importing the record-authority kernel's list would
// put a record-authority module in the lifecycle graph for the sake of an array.
// The suite asserts the two lists agree, so they cannot drift silently.
//
// ASSERTED-FACT INJECTION — the one this slice adds, and the one that matters
// here. `signed`, `approved`, `verified`, `executed`, `accepted`, `closed`,
// `is_client` and their kin are not authority claims, so the F01 list does not
// name them — but a caller that could state one would be deciding the very fact
// the transition exists to establish from evidence. Q072 settles that models
// PROPOSE and deterministic commands VALIDATE; a caller boolean is the same
// failure with the model taken out.
//
// BOTH GUARDS RUN ONLY ON KEYS THE SCHEMA DOES NOT ACCEPT. A LOADED subject
// legitimately carries `execution_state`, and a LOADED document legitimately
// carries `signature_state`; refusing those would refuse the state itself. What
// stops a caller choosing them is that the store loads subjects and evidence
// from the database and refuses a caller-supplied `subject` or `evidence` by
// name. The load-time self-check at the foot of this file proves that every key
// this module DOES accept while colliding with a guard fragment is one of four
// deliberate, server-derived exceptions.

// Q072 / Q082 — the evidence vocabulary.
//
// EVERY EVIDENCE KIND NAMES ITS SOURCE, ITS EXACT REQUIRED SHAPE, AND THE
// SUBJECT IT BINDS TO. An F01 document kind additionally names the document
// states that must hold, so "signed" is a fact read off the record layer's own
// document identity rather than a word a caller wrote. A first-party record kind
// names the record kind it needs; a typed approval names the approval kind and
// the approver class.
//
// `binds_subject_kind` IS THE SECOND HALF OF "EVIDENCE-BOUND TRANSITIONS", and
// it is the half that was missing. A record that is authentic, of the right
// kind, in the right state and pinned to the right bytes still says nothing
// about WHICH deal closed, WHICH assignment committed or WHICH client signed.
// Without a binding, one closing settlement closes every deal it is pointed at,
// a commitment recorded for assignment A commits assignment B, and a lease
// executed for one client marks another client's deal executed — all with an
// authorized actor and a valid pin. So every evidence kind declares the subject
// kind it must name, every admitted evidence record carries a SERVER-DERIVED
// `subject_binding`, and the evaluator refuses when that binding is not the
// subject the transition moves. The binding is never a field on the transition
// request: it comes off the stored first-party record's own typed columns, or
// off an independently stored evidence→subject association, and the store and
// the SQL writer re-assert it under the same lock that holds the subject.
//
// `requires_author_class` IS THE THIRD HALF, for the four facts only a partner
// may state. Q082's permitted actors bound the actor PERFORMING the transition;
// they said nothing about who AUTHORED the record it rests on, so a sponsored
// agent could write the closing date, the winning-property commitment or the
// failure reason and a partner could then launder it through by performing the
// transition afterwards. The author's own authorization class is recorded on the
// record when it is written and is checked here.
//
// `assistant_text` and `model_output` ARE NOT SOURCES, and they are not merely
// absent from the list: V5_J102_REFUSED_EVIDENCE_SOURCES names them so a request
// carrying one refuses BY NAME rather than as an unknown value. Q072 settles
// that a model may PROPOSE; nothing it writes is ever the evidence.

/**
 * Evaluate ONE typed lifecycle transition against LOADED state and LOADED
 * evidence.
 *
 * ORDERED, so a second reader reaches the same answer from the transcript:
 *   1.  The request must be readable, closed, tenant-bound and carry a
 *       server-derived actor.
 *   2.  The transition must be registered. There is no default and no free-form
 *       stage update.
 *   3.  The subject must be the kind the transition acts on.
 *   4.  The actor's authorization class must be permitted for the transition.
 *   5.  Every declared prerequisite axis must already hold; the first that does
 *       not refuses by name, naming the axis and what was observed.
 *   6.  The instrument kind, where the transition names one, must match.
 *   7.  Exactly ONE declared evidence alternative must be satisfied, with every
 *       kind in it present and nothing extra riding along.
 *   8.  Each evidence record must satisfy its own contract: the F01 document
 *       states it names, the effective window where required, the closing date
 *       where required, and the actor class the evidence itself demands.
 *   9.  No evidence may be recorded, observed or approved after `now`.
 *   10. The transition's own invariants run: an active engagement for a new
 *       assignment, the single-target constraint for a commitment, the
 *       diligence check for a closing.
 *   11. The coupled facts are computed TOGETHER and returned as one proposed
 *       state with one event list. A caller that applies part of it has broken
 *       the contract; the store applies all of it in one transaction.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// INITIALIZATION — the first row of a chain, and the ONE act in this slice that
// cannot be evidence-bound.
//
// WHY IT IS A SEPARATE EVALUATOR AND NOT A TRANSITION. A transition ADVANCES a
// subject: its `from` axes, its instrument kind and its prior conditions are all
// statements about a committed row. A transition that created its own primary
// subject would have nothing to check them against, and that is exactly the
// bypass the writer refuses by name (`j102_primary_subject_creation_refused`).
// So creation is not folded back into the transition table. It is its own narrow
// admission with its own vocabulary, and NOTHING BELOW WEAKENS A TRANSITION: the
// state an initialization produces is the EARLIEST declared state of its kind, so
// every existing prerequisite still has to be satisfied afterwards by the
// evidence-bound transition that follows.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HERE, stated plainly because it is the one place a
// reader should expect some. Every evidence kind in this slice BINDS TO A SUBJECT
// (`binds_subject_kind`), a first-party record carries that binding in its own
// typed columns, and `record-lifecycle-fact` refuses `bound_subject_not_found`
// for a subject that does not exist. An assignment mandate about assignment A
// therefore cannot be written until assignment A exists, and cannot be the
// evidence for creating it. The ordering is a fact about the rail, not a gap that
// was skipped, and the honest consequence is that an initialization rests on:
//
//   * the SERVER-DERIVED actor and its authorization class,
//   * the tenant,
//   * the PARENT CHAIN, loaded and re-checked under the writer's own lock — an
//     assignment only under an ACTIVE engagement held by a relationship that is
//     already a CLIENT (Q077), a negotiation only under an assignment that is
//     still open (Q095),
//   * a state shape that is FIXED, carries no lifecycle claim, and is refused if
//     the caller names any part of it.
//
// WHAT AN INITIALIZATION IS NOT. It is not a Client (a prospect relationship is
// `prospect`, and only a signed effective ETL or an approved equivalent moves
// it), not a Deal (Q078: only selection AND commitment create one), not an
// OPENED Assignment (`open-assignment` on a mandate record is the only way to
// reach `search` and the only producer of an `assignment_opened` event), not an
// LOI (a negotiation is created at `loi_drafted`, and `record-loi-submission`
// still requires the delivered document), and never a Tour.

  // is the whole of the admission here: an assignment cannot be started for a
  // prospect, or under an engagement that has expired or been terminated.
  //
  // HOW MUCH OF THAT GATE IS LIVE TODAY, because "cannot be started for a
  // prospect" is doing more work than "expired or terminated" is. The prospect
  // half is a live discriminator: `initialize-prospect-relationship` creates
  // relationships at `prospect` and only the ETL moves them, so an assignment
  // before signature really is refused. The lapsed half is DEFENCE IN DEPTH
  // rather than a live path: no shipped transition writes `expired`,
  // `terminated`, `client_paused` or `client_ended` at all, so those states are
  // reachable only through a receipted correction. The condition is kept because
  // the day a producer lands it must already be enforced — but it is not
  // currently exercised by any door, and the SQL fixture says so by name rather
  // than leaving a reader to assume it is covered.
  //
  // IT IS CREATED AT `research`, THE EARLIEST DECLARED PHASE, and that is a
  // deliberate narrowing rather than a convenience: creating the row at anything
  // later would let a caller reach a phase on no evidence at all.
  //
  // WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY, stated exactly, because the obvious reading
  // is wrong. `open-assignment` is still the ONLY way to reach `search` and the
  // ONLY producer of an `assignment_opened` event, so the mandate record remains
  // load-bearing for both. It is NOT the only way past `research`:
  // `record-loi-submission` admits an assignment in research, search OR
  // negotiation and writes `negotiation`, so a created assignment can reach
  // `negotiation` through an LOI without any mandate record ever being written.
  // A CREATED SHELL AND AN ASSIGNMENT OPENED ON A MANDATE ARE THEREFORE BOTH
  // `research`, and only `established_by_transition` on the row and the event
  // history tell them apart — not the phase axis a consumer reads.
  //
  // WHETHER A MANDATE SHOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE AN LOI IS AN OWNER QUESTION AND
  // IS NOT ANSWERED HERE. None of the thirteen settles an ordering obligation:
  // Q072.D1 maps search initiation TO research or search and says nothing about
  // what else may reach them. The narrow change if the owner wants it is to drop
  // `research` from initialize-property-negotiation's admitted phases below,
  // which would force open-assignment first — and would also stop a
  // research-scope assignment from ever holding a draft, which is why it is not
  // encoded on a reviewer's or an author's say-so.

 * THE FIELD CLASS IS POLICY, AND POLICY IS NOT A CALLER INPUT.

 * lifecycle or financial field `routine` therefore bought the auto-merge branch,
 * which is the one branch Q103 admits and the one that silently overwrites the
 * other partner — the exact outcome the decision exists to prevent. A caller
 * cannot supply it any more; it is DERIVED here, from this registry, and a field
 * the registry does not name is UNCLASSIFIED rather than routine.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN THE REGISTRY, and why it stops where it does. Every field this
 * module itself defines — the state axes, the structural ids and the money axes
 * — is classified, because this slice owns their meaning. NOTHING ELSE IS, and
 * the omission is deliberate: the customer-facing editable fields of a client,
 * an assignment or a deal record are not this module's to classify, and guessing
 * that (say) a phone number is routine would be inventing the very policy this
 * registry exists to hold. Those fields reconcile visibly, and the answer names
 * them as unclassified rather than pretending they were judged.
 *
 * THE ROUTINE CLASS IS DELIBERATELY EMPTY TODAY. The auto-merge branch below is
 * kept, because it is what Q103 settles and it becomes reachable the moment a
 * policy owner registers a routine field — but on today's registry no edit set
 * can reach it, and the module says so rather than leaving a reader to work it
 * out from the absence of entries.

/**
 * THE DELIBERATE GUARD COLLISIONS, and there are exactly eight.
 *
 * The two guards run only on keys a schema does not accept, so an accepted key
 * that happens to contain a guard fragment is silently exempt. That exemption is
 * correct for these eight and requires review for any additional key, so the set is
 * enumerated with its reasons and the audit below fails at import the moment a
 * new one appears. Three shapes account for all of them:
 *
 *   THE SERVER-SUPPLIED VALUES — `actor` and `owner_slug`. Both come from the
 *   record layer, and the store refuses either from a caller by name.
 *   THE LOADED EVIDENCE — `exception_approval`, which is validated by
 *   assertLifecycleEvidence like any other evidence record rather than read.
 *   THE LEGACY AND ATTESTATION FIELDS — `executed_instrument_evidence`,
 *   `legacy_closed_flag`, `closed`, `attested_by` and `attested_at`. These describe what an OLD
 *   row or an outside census SAYS. They are not assertions about J102 state; they
 *   are the input a classification or a comparison is run against, and every
 *   function reading one treats it as a claim to check rather than a fact.
