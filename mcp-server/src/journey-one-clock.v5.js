// V5-M01 pure clock kernel for decision 66427d3b (Q008.D1). This is NOT a
// receipt issuer, gateway, clock, persistence layer, or live acceptance path. A
// separately installed trusted verifier authenticates the complete envelope,
// authoritative history/inventory, exact benchmark acceptance, identities, and
// policy-derived bindings. Ordinary request JSON cannot install that verifier or
// assert verification with a flag. The projection below is an internal adapter
// seam, not a new approval policy: a projection is evidence that the verifier
// read the record, never evidence that a raw producer admitted anything.
//
// WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK, stated rather than implied:
//   * Raw-schema admission, authentication and durable append/CAS adapters.
//     Returning a history does not claim it was persisted; the caller owns the
//     durable append, which is why every result carries
//     durable_history_write_required.
//   * ANTI-ROLLBACK LIVES IN THAT ADAPTER, not here. readHistory below proves a
//     history is internally consistent and self-bound; every digest in it is
//     computable by whoever supplies it, so an OLDER GENUINE history replays
//     unless the durable store compare-and-swaps on the exact prior
//     history_digest and refuses a write whose prior does not match the stored
//     one. Sticky miss_at, the recorded amendment set,
//     origin_benchmark_manifest_digest, and the completion seals —
//     completion_receipt_ttl_policy_ms, completion_artifact_digest and
//     completion_fixture_set_digest — are each defended by that CAS alone.
//     Sealing a value into the history below binds it to THAT history and
//     nothing more: an older genuine history that never carried the seal still
//     replays unless the external store refuses the write, and this file
//     fabricates no protection it cannot provide.
//     readHistory is exported NARROWLY as readJourneyOneClockHistory so that
//     adapter can ask this kernel — rather than a second, weaker validator of
//     its own — whether a stored history is still readable. That export adds no
//     clause and softens none, and a pass from it is not an anti-rollback
//     claim: see the note on the function itself.
//     For the same reason each result carries `verified_binding` BESIDE the
//     state: the state says nothing about the accepted scope it was judged
//     under, so a store had no way to derive the scope it is writing for from
//     the computation itself. It is a read-only restatement of facts already
//     enforced here, outside the hashed state, and it authenticates nothing.
//   * The terminus accepts exactly one rollout-component-receipt.v1 and checks
//     `all_current_exact_distinct_pass` as an exact contract string rather than
//     re-implementing it, so "distinct" does no work at arity one.
//   * An amendment applies to a clock that already has history. The first
//     evaluation must present the pre-origin benchmark, because there is no
//     recorded original for an amendment to preserve yet.
//   * The two receipt shapes below are r7-EXACT and carry no schema_version:
//     consumer-gate-receipt.v1 is twenty-one closed fields and
//     rollout-component-receipt.v1 is twenty-two, and neither declares one. The
//     kernel discriminates on the producer step ref, which is required on both
//     and disjoint between them; a receipt carrying an added schema_version is
//     refused as `closed_shape` exactly as any other extra field is. That makes
//     the minimum receipt ONE artifact with ONE digest across the A00 seam:
//     digest(A00's proposed_receipt) is the origin_receipt_digest recorded here.
//   * `completion_expectation` and the two TTL maxima on `binding` are TRUSTED
//     PROJECTION FACTS, not caller assertions and not values read back off the
//     receipt they judge. The installed verifier must derive them from the
//     accepted kernel scope and the accepted policy exactly as it derives
//     `authority_class`; a projection that copies artifact_digest or
//     fixture_set_digest out of the completion receipt turns the binding below
//     into the tautology it exists to replace. The kernel cannot check that from
//     inside, which is why it is stated here rather than implied.
//     `completion_expectation` is nullable BECAUSE the exact kernel artifact is
//     not knowable at the origin: it is required only when a completion is
//     presented, so knowing the future artifact is never a prerequisite for
//     starting the clock.
//     THE FIRST COMPLETION SEALS BOTH OF THEM. The completion TTL policy that
//     admitted the terminus receipt and the exact artifact and fixture set it
//     was judged against are written into the history the moment a completion is
//     recorded, and a later projection that changes either one is refused BY NAME
//     rather than re-judging a receipt that was already accepted under them.
//     Before that first completion neither is sealed, so changing either one
//     while the clock is still running is an ordinary policy change.
// A SEALED HISTORY IS NEVER REWRITTEN HERE. v1 of the state schema sealed its
// origin_receipt_digest over a 22-field minimum; this file reads the r7-exact
// twenty-one, so a v1 history names an origin digest v2 cannot recompute.
// Silently re-deriving it would rebase a sealed origin, so a v1 history is
// refused BY NAME (`legacy_history_migration_required`) and moving it forward is
// an explicit migration owned by whoever owns the durable store.
// No live clock is read anywhere: every instant comes from the verified `as_of`.
// NO CLOCK HAS BEEN STARTED. Nothing in this repository has yet produced a
// minimum receipt, so there is no live origin — that is an absence of evidence
// here, not a proof of absence about the record as a whole.
// Chicago wall time requires a full-ICU Node build.

/**
 * READ ONE HISTORY ON ITS OWN, ON EXACTLY THE TERMS evaluate() READS IT.
 *
 * A durable store has to know whether the thing it is about to file — or the
 * thing it just read back off a disk — is a history this kernel can still read.
 * Before this export the only way to ask was to build a whole authenticated
 * projection and call evaluate(), so a store either owned a second, weaker
 * validator of its own or asked nothing at all. This is that question, asked
 * directly. It is a NARROW READ-ONLY SEAM and nothing else:
 *
 *   * It is the SAME FUNCTION. readHistory stays private and this wrapper adds
 *     no clause, drops none, and softens none. The v1 refusal by name, the
 *     recomputed history_digest, the closed shape, the instant grammar, the
 *     completion-seal pairing, the sticky miss and its event binding, the event
 *     chain and the one Q008.D1 contradiction are all exactly what evaluate()
 *     applies to the history it was handed.
 *   * IT DECIDES NOTHING. It computes no deadline, selects no origin, judges no
 *     receipt, admits nothing and returns no verdict — a history is not a clock
 *     evaluation. It reports readability and hands back a frozen copy.
 *   * IT PROVES NOTHING ABOUT ROLLBACK. An OLDER GENUINE history passes here
 *     perfectly, exactly as the header says: every digest in a history is
 *     computable by whoever supplies it. Anti-rollback remains the durable
 *     store's exact-prior compare-and-swap and is not weakened, replaced or
 *     implied by a pass here.
 *   * `now` IS EXPLICIT AND IS NEVER DEFAULTED. No live clock is read anywhere
 *     in this file, and a validator that quietly reached for the system clock
 *     would make one stored history readable or unreadable depending on when it
 *     was asked. It takes the kernel's own instant grammar — the same strings
 *     `as_of` is written in — and a caller that has only a stored history
 *     passes that history's own `evaluated_at`, which asks the self-consistent
 *     question "was this readable at the instant it was computed".
 *
 * The input is JSON-checked and SNAPSHOTTED before a clause reads it, on the
 * same terms a verified projection is, because the read walks the value more
 * than once and copy() honours an inherited toJSON: a getter or an exotic
 * prototype could otherwise hand two clauses two different answers. The result
 * is a deep-frozen copy, so a reader cannot mutate the thing it was just told
 * is well formed. evaluate() deliberately keeps calling the private readHistory
 * instead of this: the state it gets back is the object it then appends to, and
 * a frozen one could not be advanced.
 *
 * @param {object|null} history a doctorcre-v5-journey-one-clock.v2 state, or null
 * @param {string} now the instant to read it as of, in the kernel's grammar
 * @returns {object|null} a frozen copy of the history, or null when it was null
