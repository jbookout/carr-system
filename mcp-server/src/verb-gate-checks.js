// verb-gate-checks.js — server-side port of the DETERMINISTIC deny logic from
// two of the four client verb gates (bypass audit C33/C34, 2026-09-24, Joe's
// decision 0b11c89b: every place a rule can be overridden or ignored must be
// enforced).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. hooks/escalation-gate.py and hooks/blocker-decider-gate.py
// are Claude Code PreToolUse hooks, matched by tool_name regex on the DIRECT
// mcp__*__add-loop / mcp__*__record-defect call. Every other door to the same
// verb -- ./run.sh call, tools/call-verb.py, mcp-server/local-verb.mjs, and
// the mcp__*__call-verb passthrough -- recurses through THIS server's
// callTool() (see mcp.js), so a check placed in the verb HANDLER itself is
// the one enforcement point every door hits. That is the redesign an Opus
// review asked for after a client-side regex re-check (hooks/verb_gate_recheck.py,
// now deleted) proved leaky against real transcript data: 62/12,145 replayed
// commands would have been falsely denied, and several trivial bypasses
// (shell variables, `$(cat f)`, calling tools/call-verb.py directly) were
// never going to be closable from the Bash-command-text side at all.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT PORTED. Read the two Python files' classify()/
// needs_decider() before touching this file.
//   - blocker-decider-gate.py's needsDecider(): fully deterministic, reads
//     only the tool_input row's own text. Ported in full below as
//     needsDecider().
//   - escalation-gate.py's classify(): four of its five branches
//     (BOUNDARY, FACT_CAPTURE, PROTECTED, INTERNAL) are plain regex over the
//     row's own text and are ported in full below as classifyLoopText().
//     The FIFTH branch, HUMAN_WANTS_CHOICE against the partner's own last
//     transcript turn ("what are my options", "ask me", …), is NOT ported:
//     the server never receives the session transcript, so there is no data
//     to check it against. This is a real, reported behavior change — see
//     the PR description's Jev architecture_or_design receipt for the
//     alternatives considered and why fail-closed (a few more calls refused
//     with a clear message, rather than silently admitting one a transcript
//     might have exempted) was the one Jev picked.
//   - drift-claim-gate.py and rule-shape-gate.py are NOT ported: neither one
//     ever denies (drift-claim-gate only injects additionalContext; rule-shape-gate
//     is warn-only by design, per the bypass audit's C32 finding). There is
//     no verdict to move server-side.
//
// Refusals are named the same way the Python hooks name them
// (internal_decision / capability_no_decider), so a caller who has seen one
// refusal recognises the other.
