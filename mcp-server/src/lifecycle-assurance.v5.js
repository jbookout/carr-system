// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A02, half two: THE WORKFLOW AND RULE LIFECYCLE PUBLIC
// SURFACE — and, like half one, it is a surface that cannot say yes.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DECIDE, said first because it is the whole point.
//
// (1) ACTIVATION. The catalog's excluded_scope for V5-A02 begins "product
// activation", and no activation controller with a reversible, receipted,
// durable transition record exists in this repository.
//
// (2) EVERY FACT AN ANSWER WOULD STAND ON. There is no authoritative workflow
// -state reader, no rule registry reader, no control-implementation reader, no
// test-result reader and no acceptance-receipt reader here either. A caller
// object carrying `has_telemetry: true`, a reviewer id, a passing test, a
// control digest and a verifier id is a DESCRIPTION of those facts. A public
// function that turned that description into `operational`, `active`, `allow`
// or `coverage_complete: true` would be handing out authority nothing in this
// system holds — the exact defect the V5-A02 review of PR 985 named, and the
// thing the standing rule learned from nine review rounds on 2026-09-11 forbids
// under ANY name, including a "predicate", "fixture" or "unwired" variant.
//
// SO THE PUBLIC SURFACE IS THIS, and it is the whole of it:
//
//   readWorkflowLifecycle        -> status "unavailable", naming the reader owed
//   readRuleLifecycleTransition  -> status "unavailable", naming the readers owed
//   readRuleEnforcementCoverage  -> status "unavailable", naming the readers owed
//   emitRuleActivation           -> activated false, for every caller on every
//                                   input, embedding NO transition verdict
//
// NONE OF THE FOUR READS ITS REQUEST. If no field of the request can change the
// answer, no caller can smuggle authority in through one. `request_read: false`
// says so in every result.
//
// WHERE THE SHAPE LOGIC LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN src/ AT ALL. The lifecycle
// clauses are worth proving clause by clause, but a clause that can be IMPORTED
// is a clause a consumer can read an answer out of, whatever its file is called.
// So they do not live in this directory: they live in
// mcp-server/test/lifecycle-classifiers.v5.testhelper.mjs, beside the test that
// is their only caller. No module in src/ can reach them — src/ holds no
// test-only entry at all, and lifecycle-assurance.v5.test.mjs proves both halves
// of that with a parser-backed import scan (no `.testonly.` file exists here,
// and no src module imports anything under ../test/).
//
// AND THEY ANSWER IN A VOCABULARY NO CONSUMER CAN ACT ON. The helper never
// yields a lifecycle state: it yields the conditional TOKENS this module
// publishes — `would_be_operational_if_authoritative`,
// `would_be_active_if_authoritative`, one per state — which are not states and
// are not accepted anywhere as one. THE ONE PLACE A TOKEN BECOMES A STATE is
// `stateFromConditionalToken` below: module-private, not exported, and reached
// only through `readWorkflowStateFromAuthority`, which answers unavailable
// because the workflow-state reader seam is bound to null and nothing exported
// by this module can bind it.
//
// NOTHING HERE INVENTS A VOCABULARY IT COULD READ INSTEAD.
//
//   * THE ELEVEN WORKFLOW LIFECYCLE STATES AND THEIR PRECEDENCE are V5-F09's,
//     lifted from the live `ops.completion_projection` view (db/schema.sql, the
//     `possibility(lifecycle_state, applies)` VALUES list) in its own order.
//     F09 is one of this slice's three source_build_dependencies and its census
//     is what "workflow lifecycle" means in this system; a second ordering here
//     would be a second authority. The projection is SQL this module cannot
//     import, so lifecycle-assurance.v5.test.mjs reads db/schema.sql and asserts
//     the two lists are identical, in order — a schema change turns this test
//     red instead of letting the two drift apart in silence.
//   * THE SIX RULE CLASSES, THE SIX ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS and THE THREE
//     RETIREMENT BEHAVIOURS are V5-F05's and are IMPORTED from
//     rule-applicability.v5.js, never retyped, so the day F05 adds one this
//     module follows instead of drifting.
//   * THE RULE LIFECYCLE STATES are the catalog's own words for this slice:
//     "rule proposed -> reviewed -> tested/shadow -> active -> retired
//     transitions and enforcement coverage".
//
// THE TWO REMAINING EXCLUSIONS ARE ENFORCED IN THE CLAUSES, NOT DOCUMENTED:
// `rule_presence_is_not_enforcement` (a rule that names only its own binding
// text is UNMAPPED, however well written) and `shadow_miss_without_disposition`
// (a shadow window with an undisposed miss cannot advance a rule). Both reasons
// are registered here and cited by the classifiers.
//
// TWO KINDS OF NO, inherited unchanged from global-boundaries.v5.js:
//   * A POLICY ANSWER is RETURNED — `decision` is "refuse" with a stable
//     `reason_id`. On this surface there is no allow at all.
//   * A CONTRACT VIOLATION THROWS V5BoundaryError. Handing a controller in as a
//     second argument is not a policy question.
//
// DECISION BINDING. Q017.D1, Q036.D1, Q067.D1 and Q086.D1, carried in
// V5_A02_DECISION_IDS by gate-zero-assurance.v5.js and re-exported here so both
// halves of the slice bind one list. Only their routing is readable (see that
// file's header); this module claims no knowledge of their text.
