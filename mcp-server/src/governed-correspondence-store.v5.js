// DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J103: the governed correspondence store and its verbs.
//
// THE KERNELS DECIDE; THIS MODULE MAKES THE DURABLE HALF REACHABLE. It owns four
// verbs over the relations the J103 store migration installs, and no others:
//
//   correspondence-readiness              read   what is installed, consented,
//                                                read and owed, per partner
//   read-correspondence-thread            read   the provenance-preserving read of
//                                                stored adapter read receipts
//   record-correspondence-adapter-consent human  a partner's consent for one
//                                                adapter to READ their own mailbox
//   revoke-correspondence-adapter-consent human  its withdrawal
//
// THERE IS NO SEND VERB AND NO DRAFT VERB HERE, and the second absence is a
// decision rather than an omission. The draft RELATION and its writer ship in
// the migration, with every no-dispatch property held by CHECK constraints and
// proved by mcp-server/test/governed-correspondence-store-postgres.sql. A draft
// verb, though, must run governed-correspondence.v5.js's draft classification
// (privacy boundary, author seam, participant rules), and that kernel only
// drafts from a read IT produced. Its adapter-receipt lookup is deliberately
// null until an adapter exists; binding it to this store's receipts changes a
// twice-reviewed kernel's access control, so it lands WITH the F10 adapter that
// will write the first receipt, not before. Registering a draft verb now would
// register a write that can never write.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A CALLER'S WORD. The partner a consent belongs to is the
// verified-partner context the server sets for a humanOnly act — read back from
// the transaction, never an argument — and the record layer checks it again. The
// mailbox account arrives once, is normalized and digested here, and only the
// digest is sent to the database or returned. A thread read is fenced to the
// server-derived sponsor inside the database. Stored digests are recomputed on
// read and a mismatch refuses the whole read rather than skipping a row.
//
// WHAT CONSENT DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE ABOUT THE MAILBOX. The partner is
// derived; the ACCOUNT is the partner's statement. Two checks run on it today,
// here and again in the record layer: an address identity.js maps to the OTHER
// partner is refused, so neither partner can name the other's known account.
// That is all that is checked. It does NOT prove the partner owns an address
// identity.js does not know. Ownership proof arrives with the F10 installation
// binding: the adapter runs on the partner's own machine against that machine's
// local store, and the receipt writer must match the installation's account
// against the consent's account_digest before it records a single receipt.
//
// ACTIVATION IS THE HUMAN STEP, AND THIS MODULE CANNOT TAKE IT. Recording consent
// unlocks no read by itself: reads come from receipts, and the receipt writer is
// granted to no runtime role until the F10 adapter and its seat land.
// correspondence-readiness says exactly that, from the database's own grants.
