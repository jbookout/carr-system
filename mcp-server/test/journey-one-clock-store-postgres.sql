-- DoctorCRE v5 Journey 1 clock-history store: transaction-scoped PostgreSQL
-- proof of ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql.
--
-- THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN RUN. The local initdb is blocked (shmget), no remote
-- database was used as a workaround, and nothing here is wired into CI. Every
-- claim below is what this fixture WOULD assert; none of it is an observation.
--
-- EVERY FIXTURE ROW IS ROLLED BACK, AND NO JOURNEY 1 CLOCK IS STARTED BY RUNNING
-- THIS FILE. What it appends is a SYNTHETIC history composed by this file, not a
-- kernel computation, and that is the exact point of the direct-writer group
-- below: this record layer cannot tell a trusted writer's assertion from a
-- kernel computation, so the rows it stores prove storage mechanics and nothing
-- about a deadline. A run of this file records no acceptance, no receipt, no
-- admission and no clock start, and it rolls back regardless.
--
-- EXPLICIT PREREQUISITES, checked before anything is attempted. Each one SKIPS
-- with a notice rather than failing, exactly as benchmark-acceptance-postgres.sql
-- does:
--   * ops.j1_clock_append_revision must exist. It does not until
--     ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql has been applied, which is a
--     separate reviewed act.
--   * ops.portfolio_canonical_json and ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id must exist
--     (migration 0496). This rail reuses both rather than restating them.
--   * One active actor must already exist for the writer context. THIS FILE
--     CREATES NO ROLE AND NO ACTOR: minting either would manufacture the
--     identity the rail exists to derive.
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, none of which can be shown by reading SQL text:
--   * POSITIVE CAS. A creation with an explicit NULL prior lands as ordinal 0; a
--     second revision naming the head's exact digest lands as ordinal 1; the
--     readback rebuilds both and recomputes the same digest it stored.
--   * The digest is recomputed FROM THE STORED ROWS, and the parameter-form and
--     row-form builders agree for the same content.
--   * TRANSACTION SEQUENCING. Four appends land in ONE transaction, each with
--     its complete children, including one issued after the caller set
--     CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE and one issued after a refusal was caught. The
--     append guard is deferred while a revision row is inserted, forced over the
--     settled children, and restored before the call returns; a mode left in
--     force would validate the next revision row against children that do not
--     exist yet and refuse a valid append.
--   * A stale prior, a second creation, a reused idempotency key carrying a
--     changed payload, a rebased origin, a removed miss, a changed seal, a lost
--     event, a forged event digest and a lied-about history digest are each
--     refused BY NAME, with the shared invariant id in the message.
--   * The clock identity is derived: a caller-supplied key that its own origin
--     does not produce is refused, so a self-chosen alias cannot address, and
--     cannot restart, a clock.
--   * ONE AUTHORITATIVE SCOPE HOLDS ONE CLOCK, which is the refusal a NEW ORIGIN
--     meets and the derived identity never could: a second origin for a bound
--     scope, a clock rebound to a second scope, and an append for a clock with
--     no scope binding at all are each refused by name. The scope key is derived
--     from the scope's own fields here, and a scope naming other gates is
--     refused rather than hashed.
--   * A legacy v1 state schema is refused by name rather than migrated.
--   * UPDATE and DELETE are refused everywhere (append-only), and a child row
--     cannot be added to a revision a later revision already seals.
--   * Direct INSERT is executable by none of the runtime role bundles, and the
--     append function reaches the writer and authority bundles only.
--   * Every function the module's postgres journal calls exists with the exact
--     arity it calls it at.
--   * The readback says, in its own fields, that this record layer accepted no
--     deadline and lists what it cannot prove.
--   * A tampered readback is detectable: the recomputation is content-sensitive,
--     so the same rows with one field changed produce a different digest, and
--     the integrity reader reports that rather than serving the row.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, named rather than implied:
--   * That ops.j1_clock_history_digest and journey-one-clock-store.v5.js's
--     journeyOneClockHistoryDigest produce the SAME hash for the same history.
--     Both are asserted to hash the canonical serialization of the same
--     twenty-field preimage, and this side reuses ops.portfolio_canonical_json,
--     which migration 0496 already reconciles against artifact-trust.js's
--     canonicalJson -- but a SQL fixture cannot execute JavaScript. THIS IS THE
--     SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CHECK FIRST when the rail is exercised end
--     to end: run the module's own round trip over a real history, then compare
--     its digest against ops.j1_clock_history_digest_of over the same
--     decomposed content. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SCOPE KEY: ops.j1_clock_scope_digest
--     and journeyOneClockScopeKey are asserted to hash the same
--     [domain_tag, seven fields] preimage and neither side can execute the
--     other, so a disagreement there would file one program's clock under two
--     scope keys -- one for each language -- and the uniqueness both rely on
--     would silently hold over two different sets.
--   * Anything about the concurrency of two SESSIONS. One psql session cannot
--     contend with itself, so the freeze/append lock protocol is asserted
--     structurally (both modes are taken on the same row) and remains
--     live-integration verification.
--   * That any stored revision is a kernel computation. It is not: this file
--     composes its own.
--   * That a bound scope is the ACCEPTED scope of the projection some kernel
--     read. The stored state carries no subject, candidate or policy digest, so
--     the scope here is a synthetic binding this file composed, exactly as a
--     trusted integration would compose a real one. One scope holding one clock
--     is enforced; the truth of the scope is not, and is not claimed.
--
-- Digests are LEARNED with ops.j1_clock_history_digest_of, which hashes the
-- decomposed content WITHOUT writing a row, so the fixture never has to guess a
-- hash or read one out of an error message.
