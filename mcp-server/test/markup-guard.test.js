// markup-guard.test.js — the write door refuses tool-call markup in a field value.
//
// WHY. ops/store-markup-scan.py has been finding this damage AFTER the fact for
// weeks: a session composes several long fields as one block of text, the field
// swallows its own closing tag, and every parameter after that tag is written
// NULL. Six active shared rules were found carrying it on 2026-08-13, the oldest
// four days old, five with a partner's verbatim quote absorbed into the rule
// statement. On 2026-08-14 a session filing a loop ABOUT this defect reproduced
// it three times in a row while trying to describe it.
//
// The scan is a detector, and a detector cannot un-write a NULL. The record
// layer refuses to edit a closed row on purpose ("a closed loop is history"), so
// damage that reaches a row and is then closed is permanent. The only place this
// can actually be stopped is the write door, before the row exists.
//
// THE HARD PART, and the reason this is a test file and not a one-line regex:
// rows that legitimately WRITE ABOUT this defect contain the same strings — this
// very file, the rule that documents the defect, the loops that tracked the
// cleanup. A guard that cannot tell those apart blocks the system from
// describing its own bug. The signature of real corruption is STRUCTURAL: the
// field swallowed its own closing tag, or carries a bare marker that ate the
// field which should have followed. A mention keeps the markers quoted in
// backticks as prose. Same rule as ops/store-markup-scan.py's classify(), which
// has run against the live store for a week without a false positive.
