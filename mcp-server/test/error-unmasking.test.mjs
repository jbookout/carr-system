// error-unmasking.test.mjs — a verb failure must name its own cause.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS WHEN IT IS MISSING, measured on 2026-08-21 in one session:
//
//   * complete-capability-project took `select ... for update` on
//     ops.capability_verification, a table deliberately made immutable and on
//     which the serving role holds only insert and select. Row locks need
//     UPDATE. Postgres raised 42501 insufficient_privilege on every completion
//     the verb had ever attempted, and the caller saw "internal error". The AI
//     Engineering Suite therefore read 0 complete of 51 while six of its
//     projects were finished, and the count was mistaken for a measure of
//     output rather than a broken verb.
//
//   * close-loop's successor_loop and update-decision's decision_id each take
//     only a full uuid, while both verbs' own hints invite the human form —
//     "name the open loop", and an id the system itself prints in 8 characters.
//     A short id reaching a uuid column raises 22P02, and again the caller saw
//     "internal error". Two defects, one class.
//
// Every one of those was diagnosed by opening the handler's SQL, because the
// error said nothing. The detail was never actually secret: it was already
// recorded to the incident store and already returned in the JSON-RPC `data`
// field, which MCP clients drop. The only thing missing was putting it where
// the caller reads.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/error-unmasking.test.mjs
