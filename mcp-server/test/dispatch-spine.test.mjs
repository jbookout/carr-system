// WR-000119 — the dispatch spine's acceptance proofs, ONE BLOCK PER CRITERION
// on the WR-000119 card: AC-DS-LINK, AC-DS-ACK, AC-DS-HISTORY, AC-DS-REGISTRY.
//
// EVERY IDENTITY CASE MOVES THE DERIVED ACTOR. Neither verb takes an actor
// argument, so the ONLY way to prove the derivation is to change the
// transaction context and issue the SAME call again. A case that mints one
// actor and asserts one answer passes under an implementation that ignores the
// derivation entirely, and there is not one in this file.
//
// EVERY FIXTURE TIMESTAMP IS RELATIVE TO now(). The transaction clock is
// constant inside a statement, so a hard-coded instant proves nothing about
// ordering and fails on one run months from now.
//
// The store cases skip in the unit class; the migration class supplies
// DATABASE_URL and sets CARR_DISPATCH_SPINE_DB_REQUIRED=1, which turns a skip
// into a failure.
