-- DoctorCRE v5 Journey 1 ADMITTED-MINIMUM INPUT STORE: transaction-scoped
-- PostgreSQL proof of ops/journey-one-clock-input-store.candidate.sql.
--
-- THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN RUN. The local initdb is blocked (shmget), no remote
-- database was used as a workaround, and nothing here is wired into CI. Every
-- claim below is what this fixture WOULD assert; none of it is an observation.
--
-- EVERY FIXTURE ROW IS ROLLED BACK, AND NO RECEIPT IS ADMITTED TO ANY GATE BY
-- RUNNING THIS FILE. What it admits is a SYNTHETIC artifact composed by this
-- file, not one an authenticated producer issued, and that is the exact point of
-- the direct-writer group below: this record layer cannot tell a trusted
-- writer's assertion from a genuine admission, so the rows it stores prove
-- storage mechanics and nothing about a gate, a benchmark or a deadline. A run
-- of this file starts no clock and rolls back regardless.
--
-- ONE TRANSACTION IS ONE ADMISSION INSTANT, AND THAT SHAPES THE WHOLE FIXTURE.
-- ops.j1_minimum_admission_instant() is derived from now(), the TRANSACTION
-- timestamp, so every admission below shares one admitted_at and they are all in
-- ONE ordering group. The stored order is the kernel's own (admitted_at,
-- receipt_digest) selection order, so this file admits its receipts IN DIGEST
-- ORDER -- learned with ops.j1_minimum_receipt_digest before anything is
-- written, never guessed. That is not a workaround: it is the invariant under
-- test, exercised at its hardest boundary, where every row ties on instant.
--
-- EXPLICIT PREREQUISITES, checked before anything is attempted. Each one SKIPS
-- with a notice rather than failing:
--   * ops.j1_minimum_append_admission must exist. It does not until
--     ops/journey-one-clock-input-store.candidate.sql has been applied, which is
--     a separate reviewed act.
--   * ops.j1_clock_scope_digest must exist. This rail reuses THE ONE scope
--     derivation from ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql rather than
--     defining a second one, so that file must be applied first.
--   * ops.portfolio_canonical_json and ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id must exist
--     (migration 0496).
--   * One active actor must already exist for the writer context. THIS FILE
--     CREATES NO ROLE AND NO ACTOR: minting either would manufacture the
--     identity the rail exists to derive.
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, none of which can be shown by reading SQL text:
--   * THE ADMISSION INSTANT IS THE DATABASE'S. ops.j1_minimum_admission_instant()
--     is derived from now(), so the value read before the call and the value the
--     append function derives inside it are one reading; a caller naming a
--     different one is refused by name.
--   * A receipt reporting an observation AFTER that instant is refused, because
--     the kernel refuses that skew fatally and an append-only inventory could
--     never shed the row.
--   * POSITIVE PATH. An opening admission with an explicit NULL prior lands as
--     ordinal 0; each later one naming the head's exact chain digest extends the
--     ledger; ops.j1_minimum_history rebuilds them all, re-hashes every receipt,
--     recomputes every chain link, re-validates the selection order, and emits
--     the kernel's own [{admitted_at, receipt}] minimum_history in that order.
--   * The receipt digest is DERIVED from the artifact and a caller-named one is
--     only ever compared, so an artifact cannot be filed under a borrowed identity.
--   * ONE AUTHORITATIVE SCOPE HOLDS ONE INVENTORY, whose accepted TTL policy and
--     environment manifest are SEALED at opening: a changed policy, a changed
--     environment and a second label are each refused by name. One accepted scope
--     under two names hashes to ONE key, and a different accepted subject is a
--     different scope.
--   * A stale prior, a second opening, a reused idempotency key carrying a
--     changed payload, a re-presented artifact, a receipt from another producer
--     step, gate, role, oracle or scope, a receipt for another subject or
--     environment, and an overlong window are each refused BY NAME, with the
--     shared invariant id in the message.
--   * THE ORIGIN REGRESSION, IN ITS DISCRIMINATING FORM. The guard compares a
--     newcomer against the HEAD and not against the first row, because the
--     kernel skips inadmissible attempts and the row it selected need not be the
--     first one in the ledger. The fixture builds three candidates whose digests
--     are d1 < d2 < d3, admits d1 and then d3, and then offers d2: it is
--     STRICTLY GREATER than the first stored row, so a first-row comparison
--     would have admitted it, and strictly less than the head, so the kernel
--     could prefer it to a row already stored in that group. It is refused.
--   * THE FATAL SHAPE FACTS A00's seam validator leaves open are refused: a
--     wrong `safe:`/`session:` prefix, a malformed fixture-set digest, an
--     out-of-bounds comparator, and an identity seat with a fourth key or an
--     empty field. Each is a well-formed twenty-one-field receipt from the right
--     producer that the kernel would refuse fatally.
--   * NOTHING IS DISCARDED. A non-passing receipt is STORED and read back: the
--     kernel calls it an ordinary fact of the ledger and this rail has no filter.
--   * A readback whose rows are out of the selection order refuses rather than
--     being served, so a row that reached the tables by another route cannot
--     hand the kernel an origin this rail never admitted first.
--   * UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE are refused everywhere. The truncate half is
--     the only thing that can show the statement-level trigger exists: a
--     row-level trigger never sees TRUNCATE, and the `revoke` does not bind the
--     table owner. The updated column is asserted to exist on both relations
--     first, so the negative cannot fail at parse and prove nothing.
--   * Direct INSERT is executable by none of the runtime role bundles, and the
--     append function reaches the writer and authority bundles only.
--   * Every function the module's postgres journal calls exists with the exact
--     arity it calls it at.
--   * The readback says, in its own fields, that this record layer admitted
--     nothing to a gate and lists what it cannot prove.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, named rather than implied:
--   * That ops.j1_minimum_receipt_digest and journeyOneMinimumReceiptDigest
--     produce the SAME hash for one receipt, or that ops.j1_minimum_admission_digest
--     and journeyOneMinimumAdmissionDigest agree. Both sides hash the canonical
--     serialization of the same preimage and this side reuses
--     ops.portfolio_canonical_json, which migration 0496 already reconciles
--     against artifact-trust.js's canonicalJson -- but a SQL fixture cannot
--     execute JavaScript. THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CHECK FIRST
--     when the rail is exercised end to end: a disagreement would give one
--     artifact two origin digests, one per language, and the clock would name an
--     origin the other side could not find.
--   * Anything the KERNEL does with these rows. No JavaScript runs here, so the
--     "the kernel would have refused origin_reset_or_rebase" half of the origin
--     regression lives in mcp-server/test/journey-one-clock-input-store.v5.test.mjs,
--     which drives the real kernel over the real store. This side proves only
--     that the row is refused.
--   * Anything about the concurrency of two SESSIONS. One psql session cannot
--     contend with itself, so the opening/append lock protocol is asserted
--     structurally and remains live-integration verification.
--   * The STRICTLY-LATER admitted_at case. One transaction is one instant, so
--     every admission here ties; the cross-instant half of the ordering rule is
--     a multi-transaction fact and is left to live integration.
--   * That any admitted artifact is a receipt an authenticated producer issued.
--     It is not: this file composes its own.
--   * That the scope or the accepted policy this inventory was opened under is
--     any projection's accepted one. Both are synthetic bindings this file
--     composed, exactly as a trusted integration would compose real ones.
--
-- Digests are LEARNED with ops.j1_minimum_receipt_digest, which hashes the
-- artifact without writing a row, so the fixture never guesses a hash or reads
-- one out of an error message.
