// incident-verbs.test.mjs — the five verbs the 2026-08-23 rules-and-verbs
// council put first, and the two things that could make them worse than the
// break-glass path they replace.
//
// THE TWO FAILURE MODES THIS SUITE IS AIMED AT, because a passing suite that
// misses them would be worse than no suite at all:
//
//   1. A LAXER DOOR WITH A NICER NAME. close-incident exists so a partner stops
//      needing CARR_BREAK_GLASS=1 + tools/db-tap.py to close an evidence-
//      complete incident. If it closes rows tools/ops-record.py's `resolve`
//      would have refused, it did not replace that path — it undercut it. The
//      parity block below runs each of resolve_preconditions' four refusals
//      against this implementation and asserts the same answer.
//
//   2. A SECOND PILE. The whole reason ops.incident carries a signature column
//      and a partial unique index (0116) is that repeated identical failures
//      must collapse into one row. A hand-opened incident whose fingerprint is
//      built in a DIFFERENT field order from the collectors' would never
//      collide with theirs, and the same outage would sit on the board twice
//      under two spellings. The fingerprint block asserts byte equality with
//      trace.js's own signature, which is the shape assess() already writes.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/incident-verbs.test.mjs
