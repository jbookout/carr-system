// V5-A02 half one — the Gate Zero surface, proved in two halves that must not
// be confused with each other.
//
// HALF A, THE PUBLIC SURFACE. Everything `gate-zero-assurance.v5.js` exports,
// enumerated from the module namespace, swept with every caller-controlled
// input shape — including the exact one-gate `{ conclusion: "success" }`
// construction the PR 985 reviewer used to get `green: true` and
// `decision: "allow"` out of the old module — and asserted never to produce a
// privileged outcome under any name. The surface is also asserted INDIFFERENT to
// its input: every shape produces byte-identical output, so there is no field a
// caller could reach for. Plus a parser-backed scan (V8's own ESM parser, via
// vm.SourceTextModule in a child process — not a regex) proving that src/ holds
// no test-only entry at all and that no module in src/ names a specifier under
// ../test/.
//
// HALF B, THE CLAUSES. The three deterministic clauses, proved clause by clause
// through `./gate-zero-classifiers.v5.testhelper.mjs` — a helper in THIS
// directory, not a module in src/, so a production import of it is impossible
// rather than merely absent. Their answers are conditional by name
// (`would_satisfy_if_authoritative`, `would_be_green_if_authoritative`,
// `would_join_exactly_if_authoritative`) because no authoritative
// predecessor-outcome, scheduler or gate-conclusion reader exists to make them
// anything else. Every negative is a single NAMED mutation of one clean request
// that satisfies, and each `clean*()` returns a fresh deep copy so a mutation in
// one test cannot leak into another.

 * CARD 9 — THE SEAT, AND ITS MUTATION CONTROL.

 * file or a field any caller can set. It is derived from a declaration committed
 * to gate-zero-producer-registration.v5.js, exactly as the three seam rulings
 * are one committed line each — so the only way to prove the derivation is to
 * stage a copy of src with that line moved and read what the whole module then
 * answers.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARE PROVED HERE AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.
 *
 *   (1) THE SWITCH TURNS. Unstaffed, the surface answers what main answered:
 *       the seat is unbound, card 9's governance question is back on the list,
 *       the refusal is decided by the empty seat, and both staffing fields are
 *       null. Staffed, all four move together. Without this a `true` typed into
 *       the source would pass every other test in this file.
 *
 *   (2) IT DOES NOT TURN ON A CLAIM. A holder alone does not staff the seat:
 *       each falsifier moves ONE line of the declaration — the charter away from
 *       the one Joe's card-9 ruling names, the staffing ruling to something that
 *       is not a decision id, the holder to something that is not a seat ref —
 *       and the seat is unbound for each. Fail-closed is the default answer,
 *       which is the same "no" this surface gave before any seat was named.
 *
 *   (3) THE SEAT IS STILL LOAD-BEARING NOW THAT THE PRODUCER EXISTS, and this
 *       is the clause that matters most — it is the one that changed. The
 *       producer seam's `ruled` thunk asks card 9's declaration, so an unstaffed
 *       seat closes the seam and the surface goes back, byte for byte, to the
 *       refusal it gave before this slice: `producer_bound: false`, card 9's
 *       governance question back on the list, the refusal decided by the empty
 *       seat. A staffed seat BINDS the seam — and still does not make the gate
 *       pass, because a seam is a place a signature can come from and the
 *       signature is earned over rows. `passable` is false either way, which is
 *       exactly the authority this slice must not hand anybody.
