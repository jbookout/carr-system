// loop-bookkeeping-sense.test.mjs — close-loop must tell a LOOP merged into
// another loop apart from a PULL REQUEST that landed on main.
//
// THE DEFECT, hit live on 2026-08-22 closing loop #500. The bookkeeping test
// was /\b(renumbered|superseded|merged|split)\b/i applied ANYWHERE in the
// outcome text. The outcome said "Merged as PR #469" — a pull request that had
// landed, with the work finished and verified twice — and close-loop refused
// it as continuing work, telling the caller to close it as "dropped" and name a
// successor loop that does not exist.
//
// Two unrelated senses of one word. Since main here is PR-only with automerge,
// every honest close of a code loop names a landed pull request, so the guard
// fired hardest against the most common true completion it would ever see.
// "split" and "superseded" carry the same double meaning (a split file, a
// superseded API endpoint).
//
// Worse, it filtered WORDING rather than substance: rewriting "merged" as
// "landed" walked straight through, which is how that close eventually went in.
// A guard escaped with a synonym enforces nothing, while still being able to
// push a caller into recording finished work as abandoned — which corrupts
// every completion measure built on the resolution field, the exact harm the
// done/dropped split exists to prevent. Recorded as defect 3fe38a2f.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/loop-bookkeeping-sense.test.mjs
// (also picked up by `npm test`'s test/*.test.mjs glob).
