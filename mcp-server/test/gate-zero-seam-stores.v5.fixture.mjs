// The three seam stores, served from fixture rows instead of from Postgres and
// GitHub. It lives in test/ and NOT in src/, so a production module cannot
// import it — the parser-backed import scan in
// gate-zero-seam-readers.v5.test.mjs proves that rather than asserting it.
//
// HOW IT IS USED, and why it is a substitution rather than an injection. The
// reader module takes no store handle: there is no argument, no setter and no
// env var that could point it somewhere else, which is the whole point of the
// slice. So the ruled path is proved the only honest way left — the test copies
// mcp-server/src into a scratch tree, pastes a fixture decision id onto the
// exact `decision_id:` line Joe will paste his onto, REPLACES the store module
// file with this one, and imports the copied reader. What runs is the real
// reader, the real ruling gate and the real derivation over known rows.
//
// THE EXPORT NAMES AND SHAPES ARE THE CONTRACT, and the test asserts this file's
// export names are identical to the real store module's before it substitutes —
// so a store function added or renamed in src turns this red instead of silently
// leaving a path unproved.
//
// THE ROWS ARE SHAPED AS PRODUCTION WRITES THEM, and that is not decoration.
// An earlier fixture invented `source_kind: "scheduler"` for card 12, a value
// db/schema.sql's `run_source_kind_check` does not permit and no writer in this
// repository emits. The reader was written against the invention, so the passing
// test proved a clause that could never have matched a real ops.run row. The
// card 12 rows below carry `wrapper` / `bin/run-scheduled.sh`, which is what
// bin/run-scheduled.sh:275 actually writes, and there is one negative row for
// each field the receipt-binding clause reads.
//
// AND THEY GO THROUGH THE SAME TWO REDUCTIONS THE REAL STORE APPLIES. The real
// module carries no store text out to a caller: an identifier leaves as a
// digest, an instant leaves re-serialized, a status leaves as a constant or a
// count. The raw rows below are written the way the ledger and the wire write
// them — that is what makes them readable as a specification — and `ledgerRow`
// and `checkRow` reduce them exactly as the real store does. A fixture that
// skipped the reduction would hand the reader a shape production never produces,
// and every clause proved over it would be proved against fiction.
//
// Every fixture case is addressed by a query value, so one module covers the
// whole clause table and no case can leak into another.

import { createHash } from "node:crypto";

// Re-declared, not imported: substituting the module file means the copied
// reader must get its error class and its closed reason set from HERE, and the
// test asserts the real module's export names are all present below.
// MODULE-PRIVATE, exactly as in the real store module, and for the same reason:
// the substituted reader reads `.because` straight into an answer, so the set it
// can come back with has to be a set nothing outside this file can enumerate or
// extend. Neither name is exported, so the export-parity check in the test still
// sees this file's surface as the real module's.
