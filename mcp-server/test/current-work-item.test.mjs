// current-work-item.test.mjs — one verb answers "what is being worked right now".
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The tune-up council of 2026-08-21 ruled that the binding
// dysfunction was a missing completion surface: work entered cheaply and never
// formally left, and no single read could say what was current. Answering it
// took a read of the engineering suite, a read of the sourced queue, and a
// guess — which is how the suite sat at "0 complete of 51" while six of its
// projects were finished and nobody could tell.
//
// WHAT THE COUNCIL ASKED FOR, and what these cases pin:
//   the active item(s), with owner, done-predicate, and blocker-or-null.
//
// Each of those four words is a case below, because each was a way the previous
// answer went wrong:
//   * ACTIVE — a blocked or needs-Joe row is STILL CURRENT and is never skipped.
//     Dropping it is how a queue looks empty while nothing can move.
//   * OWNER — who answers for it and who has hands on it are different
//     questions; one "assignee" field loses one of them.
//   * DONE-PREDICATE — the acceptance predicates if the row carries them, else
//     the written completion definition, else null. Never invented.
//   * BLOCKER-OR-NULL — present even when null, because an absent field and
//     "not blocked" read identically in a payload and mean different things.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/current-work-item.test.mjs
