// hermes-r0-lock.test.mjs — the twelve R0 refusal cases, run against the real
// server logic instead of against a fixture that asserts itself.
//
// PROVENANCE. phase0/hermes-runtime-evaluation-fixtures.v1.json has carried
// twelve expected outcomes since 2026-08-12 and had never been executed: its
// capability profile (`hermes_r0_readonly_pilot`) and its three named verbs
// existed nowhere in the server, so there was nothing for the cases to run
// against. This file is what makes them a test rather than a description.
//
// WHAT CHANGED IN THE MAPPING, stated plainly rather than quietly. The fixture
// names three bespoke read verbs (carr.deal_health.read_v1,
// carr.doctrine_excerpt.read_v1, carr.runtime_context_metadata.read_v1). None
// was built, and building them would have duplicated deal-board, read-doctrine
// and standing-context, which already return exactly those three things. Rule
// 49c627cc says to match a capability on BEHAVIOR, never on a verb name, so the
// allow cases assert the behaviour the fixture asked for — reads reach the
// runtime — against the verbs that actually serve it. The refusal cases are
// unchanged in substance, because a refusal is the half that has to be exact.
//
// The boundary being tested is held credentials and autonomous authority, never
// confidentiality (rule d7f74c93). Joe closed the exposure question on
// 2026-08-12, and every frontier council seat, Grok included, has read entire
// CARR doctrines already.
