// Unit tests for the DoctorCRE v5 durable role-description store.
//
// HOW TO RUN EXACTLY THESE CASES:
//   cd mcp-server && node --test test/model-role-store.v5.test.mjs
// `npm test` in that directory runs `node --test test/*.test.js test/*.test.mjs`,
// which is the WHOLE repository suite. A green `npm test` is therefore not a
// statement about this file and must not be reported as one; name this file.
//
// THE DATABASE HERE IS A MOCK, AND NOTHING IN THIS FILE IS EVIDENCE THAT
// ANYTHING WAS STORED. `mockDatabase` records the statements the module issues
// and returns the rows the test hands it. That is enough to prove what the
// module SENDS, what it REFUSES, and what it refuses to send — and it is not,
// and is not treated as, a claim about durable behaviour. The
// transaction-scoped proofs against a real PostgreSQL live in
// model-role-store-postgres.sql, and ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql has not
// been applied to any database by this change.
//
// THE LAST FOUR CASES READ ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql AS TEXT and assert
// what it does and does not contain — chiefly that it holds no migration program:
// no ALTER TABLE, no ADD COLUMN, no DROP CONSTRAINT, no backfill. That is a
// static source check, it is labelled as one where it sits, and it is evidence
// about a FILE rather than about a database.
//
// The pure half of this file is stronger than the mocked half, and deliberately
// so: the round trip, the digest binding, the readback revalidation and every
// refusal of a forged or edited role are properties of functions that touch
// nothing. The mock exists only to show which parameters cross the boundary and
// which calls never happen at all.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS FILE CANNOT REACH, named rather than left implicit:
//   * CONCURRENCY. A stale compare-and-swap losing a race, and a second
//     creation colliding with a first, are properties of the lock and the
//     ledger inside PostgreSQL. What is asserted here is that the module states
//     the expectation EXPLICITLY on every call and carries the creation
//     assertion as its own parameter rather than as a null the database has to
//     interpret. model-role-store-postgres.sql exercises the refusals.
//   * THE SQL SIDE OF THE NON-EMPTY-TEXT RULE. What is pinned here is the
//     ECMAScript half, exhaustively: every code point `String.prototype.trim`
//     strips, and no other. ops.model_role_ecmascript_whitespace() enumerates
//     the same list by code point so the two can be compared, and
//     model-role-store-postgres.sql asserts the SQL half against that list on a
//     live server. Neither file can prove the other's engine.
//   * WHETHER A HUMAN WAS PRESENT. The module evaluates an actor object the
//     server built and the record layer derives its own two principals; this
//     file can show that all three are compared and that a disagreement refuses.
//     It cannot show that the runtime that built the actor object was honest,
//     and `principal_binding.unbound_seam` says so on every result.
