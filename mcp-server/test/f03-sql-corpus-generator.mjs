// Generate the SQL leg's design-contract vectors from the SHARED F03 corpus.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS.  The engineering-slice-plan.v2 design contract is stated
// three times: in JavaScript (mcp-server/src/engineering-runtime.js), in Python
// (tools/room-bridge/engineering_passport.py) and in SQL (the two candidates
// under ops/).  The first two are proved equivalent by replaying one shared,
// versioned corpus -- test/fixtures/f03-design-contract-parity.v1.json -- through
// both validators.  The SQL leg consumed none of it: its two fixtures were
// 2,941 lines of hand-written vectors, so on the day someone finally ran them
// they would have proved the database against a DIFFERENT set of cases than the
// two validators it has to agree with, and a case added for JS and Python would
// never have reached the database at all.
//
// This generator closes that.  It materializes every corpus vector exactly as
// f03-design-contract-parity.test.mjs materializes it -- the same four pure
// ops, the same three seal modes, the same canonicalDigest -- and emits them as
// SQL parts the two hand-written fixtures include.  A vector added to the
// corpus for JS and Python is then automatically a vector the SQL leg must
// satisfy, and there is nothing to keep in step by hand.
//
// THE OUTPUT IS GENERATED, NEVER EDITED.  A generated fixture someone can edit
// by hand is the same defect one level down, so both emitted files carry a
// do-not-edit header and the corpus digest they came from, and
// f03-design-contract-parity.test.mjs byte-compares the files on disk against
// what this generator produces from the corpus in the tree.  Editing either
// file, or changing the corpus without regenerating, turns that test red.
//
// NO VALIDATION RULE LIVES HERE.  This file moves JSON and writes SQL.  The two
// places it makes a judgement about the SQL leg are stated in the open, carried
// into the generated headers, and both are structural facts about a vector
// rather than a restatement of any validator's logic:
//
//   1. THE v1 BOUNDARY.  ops.engineering_slice_plan_refusal returns null for
//      any engineering-slice-plan.v1 plan on purpose (see the candidate's "THE
//      v1 BOUNDARY" comment): an accepted v1 plan is not put through the
//      successor version's rules.  So the SQL leg accepts all six v1-legacy
//      corpus vectors, including the five that JS and Python both refuse.  That
//      is asserted here as the SQL leg's own documented divergence rather than
//      hidden by dropping the vectors -- the same treatment the corpus already
//      gives the JS/Python divergences.
//   2. WHICH REJECTIONS THE PER-SLICE SEAM OWNS.  The receipt candidate's
//      ops.engineering_receipt_design_contract_refusal validates ONE slice, so
//      it cannot see a plan-level rule.  A rejected vector is asserted against
//      it only when the vector is structurally incapable of tripping one: every
//      op lands strictly inside a single slice's design_contract, the plan is
//      resealed, the base carries exactly one slice (so no cross-slice rule has
//      two slices to compare), and no op touches seam_decision (seam authority
//      is a plan-level rule in this seam).  Everything else is recorded as an
//      excluded case with its reason and counted at run time, never silently
//      dropped.  Those vectors keep their whole-plan assertion in the other
//      generated part.
//
// Usage:
//   node mcp-server/test/f03-sql-corpus-generator.mjs --check   (default)
//   node mcp-server/test/f03-sql-corpus-generator.mjs --write
//
// This script reads two files, writes two files under --write, and does nothing
// else.  No database, no network, no record layer.
