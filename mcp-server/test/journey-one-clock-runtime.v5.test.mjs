// journey-one-clock-runtime.v5.js — the seat that joins the admitted-minimum
// inventory, the kernel and the clock history.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE IS AND IS NOT. The REAL loop — a real composer over a real
// admitted inventory, a real kernel and the real store — is exercised end to end
// in journey-one-minimum-integration.v5.test.mjs, where the one artifact those
// three rails share is already built; duplicating that fixture here would be a
// second home for it. This suite is about what the SEAT itself does: its
// construction refusals, the two facts it derives rather than accepts, the order
// in which it refuses, and the composition binding, driven exhaustively as the
// pure function it is.
//
// The doubles below stand in for the rails on purpose and are honest about it:
// each one is a recorder of calls, not a model of the thing it replaces, and no
// assertion here is evidence about a rail's own behaviour. Nothing is
// authenticated, no receipt is issued and no clock is started.
