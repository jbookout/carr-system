// decision-short-id.test.mjs — update-decision must accept the form this system
// itself prints.
//
// THE DEFECT (69fb49b1, filed 2026-08-22 as the same class as close-loop's
// successor field, defect 3eb1ad6d). `update-decision` took `decision_id`
// straight into `where subject_id = $1` — a uuid column — so only the full
// 36-character form worked. But the EIGHT-character short form is what the
// system prints: open loop 501's own source_note cites "decisions f58ffba8,
// 91020f79, 6a38ac5d and f1773115", and decision-history renders the same form.
// Passing one of those back into the verb that corrects decisions raised 22P02
// in the driver. Until pull request 465 that surfaced as a bare "internal
// error"; after it, an honest but still unhelpful invalid_text_representation.
//
// Either way the verb refused the only id the caller had. That is rule
// 3a9dbafd's shape (never make a partner decode an id) and the reason
// resolveRuleId exists one screen up in the same file.
//
// `detach-decision` carried the same field with a quieter symptom: its pointer
// stores decision_id as TEXT, so a short form matched nothing and reported
// not_attached — "no such pointer" rather than "wrong form of id". Same fix.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/decision-short-id.test.mjs
// (also picked up by `npm test`'s test/*.test.mjs glob).
