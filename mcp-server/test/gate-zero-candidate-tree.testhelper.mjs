// THE CANDIDATE-TREE STAGING, ONE COPY, SHARED (2026-09-14, PR 1014 third
// correction; merged with PR 1013's fifth correction under amendment 9).
//
// WHY IT IS HERE. The producer takes no argument, so the only honest way to ask
// what it answers under a different world is to stage a whole candidate tree and
// read what the module then says. Step B's write verb owes the SAME staging for
// the opposite reason: its test must drive the registered verb through the real
// dispatch path over a receipt the real producer really emitted, never a
// hand-built object, and the only place such a receipt exists is inside one of
// these trees.
//
// IT IS LIFTED, NOT RETYPED - the same discipline, and for the same reason, as
// gate-zero-reachability-walk.testhelper.mjs beside it: a retyped harness is a
// second implementation that passes because it was written from the same
// misunderstanding as the code it checks. Every suite below imports THIS file,
// so a correction to the staging corrects all of the proofs at once. The bytes
// are Step A's own staging, moved rather than rewritten.
//
// WHAT A STAGED TREE HOLDS, AND WHAT IT POINTEDLY DOES NOT (standing-rule
// amendment 9, 2026-09-14). There is NO `.git` - that is the production
// condition, because Cloudflare serves the bundle over a read-only virtual
// filesystem with no repository in it - and `stageTree` asserts its absence
// before it returns. What stands in its place is the pair a deploy really has:
//
//   * mcp-server/src - a copy, with the store module replaced by the fixture,
//     and with card 9's seat declaration or the three `decision_id:` lines
//     edited when a case asks;
//   * mcp-server/test - the sealed fixture bytes the fixture-set digest covers;
//   * ops/config/environments.json - the environment manifest its digest covers;
//   * and the THREE BUILD STAMPS `bin/deploy-worker.sh` writes with
//     `wrangler --var`, computed here over exactly those staged bytes by
//     `sealStagedTree`, so a byte-level control still moves the digest.
//
// IT DECIDES NOTHING. Every function here copies bytes, edits a line it has
// asserted matches exactly once, computes a digest over what it staged, or
// imports a module out of the tree it built. No assertion about Gate Zero lives
// in this file.
