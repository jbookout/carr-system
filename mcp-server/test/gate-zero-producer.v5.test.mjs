// V5-A02 STEP A — THE GATE ZERO PRODUCER, proved the only way a seam that takes
// no argument can be proved: by staging a whole candidate tree, editing the
// things a RUN differs by, and reading what the module then answers.
//
// THERE IS NO INJECTION POINT AND THAT IS THE SUBJECT. `v5A02GateZeroEmitOutcome`
// has arity zero. It cannot be handed evidence, a hash, an identity, a revision,
// a reader or a store; the standing rule of 2026-09-11 forbids a public function
// that turns a caller's description of evidence into a verdict, under any name,
// and a function with nowhere to put one cannot have the defect. Since the PR
// 1013 correction it cannot be handed an IDENTITY either, and that is the other
// half: the producer reads the authenticated call it is running inside, so a
// process that cannot authenticate cannot obtain a receipt at all.
//
// EVERY CASE RUNS UNDER THE PRODUCTION CONDITION, WHICH IS NO `.git` AT ALL
// (standing-rule amendment 9, 2026-09-14). The staged trees used to hold a real
// loose object store, and every case that showed the producer working had first
// built the one thing the deployed Worker does not have. The fifth review round
// named it a P0: Cloudflare bundles the modules wrangler was pointed at, serves
// them over a read-only virtual filesystem, and supplies no `.git` directory —
// so in production the old derivation had exactly one reachable answer, which
// was to refuse. NO STAGED TREE HERE WRITES A `.git`, and the suite asserts that
// no staged tree HAS one before it asserts a receipt was produced. The mutation
// control is `reintroduceGitDerivation`, which puts a repository read back into
// the staged producer and turns the produced cases red.
//
// SO EVERY CASE BELOW IS A STAGED TREE under node_modules/.cache, holding:
//
//   * mcp-server/src — a copy, with the store module replaced by
//     ./gate-zero-producer-stores.v5.fixture.mjs, and with card 9's seat
//     declaration or the three `decision_id:` lines edited when a case asks;
//   * mcp-server/test — the sealed fixture bytes the fixture-set digest covers;
//   * ops/config/environments.json — the environment manifest its digest covers;
//
// and a set of BUILD STAMPS computed over exactly those bytes and written into
// the process environment for the duration of the call, which is what
// bin/deploy-worker.sh writes into a real upload with `wrangler --var`. The
// bytes still decide the digests; what changed is WHO READS THEM — the deploy
// wrapper's sealer, at build time, instead of the Worker at request time. That
// the sealer's digests move with the bytes is proved over a real git repository
// in gate-zero-candidate-seal.test.mjs; that the receipt's digests move with the
// stamp is proved here.
//
// Nothing in src reaches those trees, no argument selects one, and no
// environment variable OTHER THAN THE THREE DECLARED BUILD STAMPS moves an
// answer — which is its own test near the end of this file, run in a fresh
// process against a hostile environment.
//
// HOW THE AUTHENTICATED CALL IS OBTAINED, and it is the fifth correction round's
// subject. Nothing here mints or fabricates an actor, because identity.js no
// longer exports anything that could. The suite writes the recorded REVIEW_TOKENS
// map into its own process environment — becoming the server, the only way a
// suite now can — and then calls `serveReviewRequestAuthenticated` with an
// Authorization header, exactly as index.js's /mcp route does. That one entry
// matches the bearer internally, derives the identity internally, enters the
// context internally, and runs the continuation inside it; the continuation goes
// through the staged tools.js's `executeRegisteredTool`, so the producer runs
// inside a real verb call. A caller-chosen bearer authenticates nobody, and
// there is no second export to compose with anything — which is control 11.
//
// THE CONTROLS, and each is named where it is asserted:
//   1. an authenticated request + every row present -> passable, digest, instant
//   2. an UNAUTHENTICATED invocation                -> refused, and no receipt
//  11. every export, walked recursively             -> none mints an identity and
//                                                      none enters a context
//  12. the real request entry                       -> is what establishes the
//                                                      identity the producer reads
//   3. the receipt's producer identity              -> equals the authenticated seat
//   4. each of the three clauses turned off         -> the gate refuses or fails
//   5. each digest against its own stamp            -> one byte moves it
//   6. the seat back to unstaffed                   -> the whole slice goes dark
//   7. an injected non-green conclusion             -> status "fail", denials observed
//   8. subject maker == the reviewing seat          -> denied
//   9. a caller-supplied anything                   -> unreachable, by parse and call
//  10. the producer callable                        -> unreachable from every src
//                                                      namespace, by the repository's
