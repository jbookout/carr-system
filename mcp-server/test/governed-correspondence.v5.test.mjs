// V5-J103 — governed correspondence reads, drafts, proposed facts and source
// reconciliation, proved case by case.
//
// Everything here is synthetic and nothing reaches a database, a provider, a
// network, a clock or the filesystem. The module under test is pure, so this
// suite can prove the properties that actually matter about a correspondence
// kernel:
//
//   * that a read PRESERVES account and native provenance on every answer it
//     gives, including the refusals,
//   * that a draft and a proposed fact are structurally unable to dispatch — no
//     recipient destination, no provider operation, and a dispatch field refused
//     before any value is read — with F10 as the INDEPENDENT ORACLE for the send
//     refusal, since F10 owns the operation registry,
//   * that a conflict shows BOTH values with the source that owns each, and that
//     every way of saying "whoever wrote last wins" is refused by name,
//   * that the four conflict kinds this module routes are exactly the four F01
//     emits — driven out of resolveObservation rather than asserted from a
//     comment,
//   * that the observation candidate a proposal builds is one F01 ITSELF accepts,
//     so the mapping is not graded by the code that produced it,
//   * that ambiguity resolves to private and never falls through to a read,
//   * and that both-partner coverage is unreachable from every input.
//
// NO FIXTURE NAMES A REAL THING: every account, participant, digest and native id
// below is unmistakably test data on an .invalid domain.

// and throws if a privileged string survives the rename.

// THE IMPORT GUARD IS A REAL PARSER, NOT A HAND-ROLLED TOKENIZER.

// and they missed `import /* x */ "./google-oidc.js";`. The second version was a
// tokenizer written for this file, and the third review broke THAT: it treated a
// non-breaking space as punctuation, so `import "./google-oidc.js";` — valid
// ECMAScript, a real side-effect import of a fetching module — was invisible and
// the closed-set assertion downstream stayed green.
//
// The lesson both rounds taught is that a JavaScript parser written by hand in a
// test file is a liability, so this one is not written here. The parse is done by
// esbuild, which is present in mcp-server/node_modules (acorn, es-module-lexer and
// typescript are not), and which reports the module's imports — static, dynamic,
// and require() — with the kind of each. Its parser is the same one that compiles
// this repository's Worker bundle, so it agrees with the engine about whitespace,
// comments, strings, templates and regular expressions without this file having an
// opinion about any of them.
//
// Two things esbuild cannot answer are answered CONSERVATIVELY, on purpose. A call
// site whose specifier is not a literal (`import(name)`, `require(name)`) resolves
// to no path at all, and `createRequire` reaches CommonJS without the token
// `require(` appearing anywhere. Both are found by counting names in the raw text,
// which over-reports — a mention inside a comment counts — and that is the safe
// direction: a false alarm is a review, a missed call site is a hole in the
// allow-list.
