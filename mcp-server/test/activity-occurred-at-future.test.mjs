// activity-occurred-at-future.test.mjs — a touch cannot have happened tomorrow.
//
// WHAT WAS FOUND, 2026-08-15, while pulling context for the vendor-level drift
// list: of 59 vendors carrying a last-touch date, FOUR were dated after today —
// 2026-08-18, two on 2026-08-26, and 2026-08-27. The nearest is three days out,
// which reads exactly like a booked meeting logged as though it had happened.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS, and it is not tidiness: last_touch is what staleness is
// measured from. A vendor whose last touch is in the future can never read as
// stale, no matter how long it has actually been since anyone spoke to them. The
// row goes quiet and no surface can tell.
//
// THE FIELD ALREADY MEANT THIS. log-activity documents occurred_at as "when it
// happened (defaults now)", past tense, and the activity table already draws
// this boundary from the other side: migration 0017 stopped a `note` moving
// last_touch because a note is annotation rather than contact. A future date
// crosses the same line in the other direction. No new ruling was needed and
// none was asked for — the doctrine store was searched for any decision on touch
// dates or scheduled contact and returned nothing.
//
// THE FUTURE ALREADY HAS ITS OWN VERBS: set-next-action for the ball you owe,
// add-critical-date for a dated deal obligation. A scheduled meeting belongs in
// those, not in the record of what has already occurred.
//
// TOLERANCE: a small skew window is allowed, because a caller's clock and the
// server's are not the same clock and a touch logged "now" can arrive a few
// seconds ahead. The window is minutes, not days — it exists for clock skew, not
// for scheduling.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/activity-occurred-at-future.test.mjs
