// linkedin-activity-urn.test.mjs — coverage for the LinkedIn reference gap,
// found live 2026-08-19 by the weekly social-metrics run.
//
// THE DEFECT. `measure-placement` resolves a placement by a stored key: the
// placement uuid, the Blotato post id, or `placement.url`. For LinkedIn that URL
// is whatever Blotato reports as `postUrl`, which is the share/ugcPost form
// (urn:li:share:… / urn:li:ugcPost:…). LinkedIn NEVER shows a person that id.
// The recent-activity feed, the per-post analytics link, and the entire rendered
// DOM carry only the ACTIVITY urn. So a human — or a session driving a browser —
// reads real impressions off LinkedIn and then cannot record them against
// anything, because the handle they hold matches no stored key.
//
// The two ids are minted for the same post milliseconds apart and are NOT
// derivable from one another, which is what makes this a real gap rather than a
// string-format problem:
//     2026-08-05  stored ugcPost 7490800344260841472  activity 7490800345598779392
//     2026-08-03  stored share   7490064185725280256  activity 7490064188413870080
//     2026-07-31  stored ugcPost 7488980086407389184  activity 7488980089368469505
// Constructing the share urn from the activity id was tried against production
// and correctly refused.
//
// COST BEFORE THE FIX: four readings stranded in a single week, including the
// best-performing post on any platform (2026-08-07, 271 impressions), on the
// channel that out-reaches every other by roughly an order of magnitude. It
// would have stranded four or five more every week for as long as it stood.
//
// THE BRIDGE. Both ids are Snowflake-shaped, so the high bits are the publish
// time (ms = id >> 22). Measured against all four stranded posts on 2026-08-19,
// each activity urn decoded to within 0.1 SECONDS of a real linkedin
// placement's live_at, while the next-nearest linkedin placement sat ~170,000
// seconds away — better than three orders of magnitude of separation. The
// resolver therefore matches inside a ±90s window and REFUSES as ambiguous if
// two placements fall inside it, rather than guessing.
//
// What this file locks down is the decode and its guards. The window match and
// the ambiguity refusal are SQL and are exercised against a real database by the
// migration/db classes; what can silently rot here is the parsing — a regex that
// starts matching the wrong urn type, or a shift that quietly returns 1970.
