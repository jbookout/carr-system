// call-verb passthrough tests.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. call-verb is the deploy-gap passthrough: it grants a
// session reach to a verb the connector has not cached yet. It shipped with no
// test at all, and on 2026-08-13 it was found to be delivering EMPTY ARGUMENTS
// to every verb reached through it. The old dispatch line was
//
//     callTool(env, actor, inner, (args && args.args) || {}, profile)
//
// and when a client serialized the nested object as a JSON string, the string
// was truthy, so it sailed through `||` and reached the inner verb intact-as-a-
// string. The inner verb then read each field off a string, got undefined, and
// answered with its own "missing_<field>" error — so a passthrough bug wore the
// mask of a caller mistake. A session trying to file a defect spent four
// attempts rearranging idempotency_key before probing with a known-good id and
// realising the payload never arrived at all. The defect log was unreachable
// the whole time, which is the one record the system keeps about its own
// failures.
//
// CHOOSING A PROBE THAT ACTUALLY PROVES FORWARDING. The first version of this
// file used read-loop and asserted "the inner verb did not say its argument was
// missing". That was worthless: read-loop opens a database connection BEFORE it
// validates, so with no database every call fails identically and the assertion
// passes whether or not the payload arrived. The probe used here instead is the
// payload-aware profile guard in callTool, which reads args.ownership for
// add-premises under the away profile purely in memory, before any client is
// created. It therefore reports on the forwarded object itself. Under the old
// code a stringified payload has no .ownership, slips past that guard, and ends
// at a database error; under the fix it is caught. The test fails on the bug
// and passes on the fix, which is the only property that makes it worth having.
