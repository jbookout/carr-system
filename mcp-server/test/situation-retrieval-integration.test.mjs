// read verb that filters the actor table on kind or active dies with "permission
// denied for table actor" — a driver error, flattened by mcp.js to a bare
// "internal error" that names nothing. That is the most natural query anyone
// would write, which is why it needs a contract rather than vigilance.
//
// This asserts the SHAPE. Every site that filters actor this way is listed with
// the verb that owns it and why it is safe. A new one fails this test until
// someone classifies it — and if it belongs to a READ verb, the answer is a
// definer function like retrieval_visibility_actor_id, never a wider grant.
//

// `active = true`. A scan for `active\s*=` alone would have missed every one.
