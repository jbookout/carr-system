// V5-J102 — the CRE lifecycle kernel, proved case by case.
//
// Everything here is synthetic and pure: no database, no network, no provider,
// no filesystem, no clock. Every evaluation takes `now` from the fixture.
//
// NO FIXTURE NAMES A REAL THING. Every client, property, document, digest and
// reason below is unmistakably test data. Nothing here is a claim about a real
// CARR client, a real deal or a real Salesforce record.
//
// THE SUITE IS ORGANISED BY DECISION, not by function, because the thing worth
// checking is that each settled requirement is actually enforced somewhere — and
// in particular that the FOUR OVERRULED RECOMMENDATIONS did not creep back in.
// The four cases that would catch that regression are marked in their titles.
