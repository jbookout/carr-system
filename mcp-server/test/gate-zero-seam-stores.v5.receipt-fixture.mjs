// A SECOND store fixture, for the one clause production rows cannot separate.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. In production
// ops.accept_sourced_work_request_outcome_feedback writes the acceptance
// receipt's hash EQUAL to the proposal's, so a reader that consulted the
// proposal's `feedback_hash` instead of the receipt's `accepted_feedback_hash`
// looks correct on every row the record layer will ever hold. Mutation testing
// found exactly that: swapping the two fields changed no assertion. The clause
// is the most load-bearing one in card 11 — it is what makes a forged hash fail
// to match a SIGNATURE rather than merely a proposal — and it was unproved.
//
// So these rows do what no production row does: they pull the two hashes apart,
// one work request per case, and the same three steps address them. Each case is
// a row the store could hold if something went wrong, which is the only
// condition under which the distinction matters.
//
// It lives in test/ for the same reason the other fixture does, and the same
// parser-backed import scan proves nothing in src/ can reach it.

// MODULE-PRIVATE, exactly as in the real store module, and for the same reason:
// the substituted reader reads `.because` straight into an answer, so the set it
// can come back with has to be a set nothing outside this file can enumerate or
// extend. Neither name is exported, so the export-parity check in the test still
// sees this file's surface as the real module's.
