// V5-A02, the seam half — the three evidence readers Gate Zero is owed, proved
// in four parts that must not be confused with each other.
//
// PART A, THE RULING GATE, WHICH JOE OPENED ON 2026-09-11. Cards 11, 12 and 13
// are ruled: three decision ids are pasted onto the three `decision_id:` lines,
// and this part asks both halves of what that means.
//
//   RULED, of the SHIPPED modules. Each reader names its OWN card's decision id
//   and its own card's store — three distinct ids, so a reader that read another
//   card's line fails on the id rather than on the row it went on to read — and
//   each one STILL REFUSES, because a ruling says where to read and nothing more.
//   No store is reachable in this suite: no credential is set, so the real store
//   module refuses, and the refusal it gives is the observable proof that the
//   only thing the paste changed is that the reader now goes and looks.
//
//   UNRULED, on a staged copy whose three lines are back to null. That copy is
//   the test-only override described on `stageTree` — an edit to a file under
//   node_modules/.cache, imported by path. Nothing in src reaches it, no argument
//   selects it and no environment variable points at it. Against it, the clause
//   this part used to make of production still stands: each reader returns the
//   gate's OWN answer, pinned by the repository's canonical digest rather than by
//   a field-by-field comparison against a shape that happens to match today, for
//   every query shape including hostile ones. That is the behaviour Gate Zero
//   falls back to if a ruling is ever withdrawn.
//
// PART B, THE PUBLIC SURFACE, AND THE SWEEP HAS NO EXEMPTIONS. The export list
// of all three modules is exactly enumerated. EVERY export is swept — constants
// by value, callables by CALLING them, and CONSTRUCTORS BY CONSTRUCTING THEM,
// with no argument and with each hostile argument in each position, and sweeping
// what comes back or what they throw. The sweep looks for the closed union of
// privileged words as exact value, as token, AND as raw substring; for any
// `would_*` or `*_if_authoritative` key; and for the boolean `true` anywhere at
// all, under any key.
//
// THE NAMED EXEMPTION THAT USED TO SIT HERE IS DELETED. An earlier draft swept
// `SeamStoreUnreachable` by constructing it with its OWN closed reasons and a
// well-formed store ref, which is the one input shape that could never leak, and
// skipped it otherwise. Under that exemption the constructor interpolated and
// retained whatever a caller handed it — a store ref, a reason, and the whole
// `cause` object — and the sweep never saw it. It is now constructed with the
// same hostile arguments as everything else, and its own properties, message,
// stack and cause are swept in turn.
//
// THE STRING ALLOWLIST THE EARLIER DRAFT CARRIED IS DELETED. It existed because
// the reader module reused the gate's own seam names and reason ids verbatim,
// and those contain "read" ("read-only", "readback") and "active"
// ("scheduler-active-receipt"). The module no longer emits any of them: seams
// are addressed by opaque card tokens, and its findings are its own words. So
// there is nothing left to exempt and nothing is exempted.
//
// WHAT REPLACES IT IS NOT AN ALLOWLIST BUT AN IDENTITY. While no seam is ruled,
// a reader's answer IS the gate's answer — the object `readGateZeroPredecessorJoin`
// or `readGateGraphAssurance` built, returned unmodified. That object is main's,
// not this slice's, and its strings are Gate Zero's live refusal: renaming them
// would change what Gate Zero says to every caller, which this PR must not do.
// So a returned value that is digest-identical to a gate answer is asserted to
// BE that answer rather than swept for words. Identity is the stronger check —
// a word sweep permits any new string that dodges the union, and identity
// permits no new string at all.
//
// PART C, THE RULED PATH OVER ROWS, ON A STAGED TREE. mcp-server/src is copied
// into a scratch directory, a DISTINCT FIXTURE decision id is put on each of the
// three `decision_id:` lines in place of the id Joe pasted there, and the copied
// reader is imported. The fixture ids stay because they are what makes the
// per-card claim falsifiable: the three ids differ, so a reader that looked up
// another card's line is caught by the id before it reads a row. Four stagings:
//
//   * with the store module REPLACED by ./gate-zero-seam-stores.v5.fixture.mjs,
//     whose rows are shaped exactly as production writes them, which proves
//     every clause including one negative row per field of card 12's
//     receipt-binding clause;
//   * with ./gate-zero-seam-stores.v5.receipt-fixture.mjs, which pulls the
//     acceptance receipt's hash apart from the proposal's — the one thing no
//     production row can do, and the clause mutation testing found unproved;
//   * with ./gate-zero-seam-fault-injection.testhelper.mjs, a DISTINCT store
//     instance whose three fetchers misbehave — one throws a value that is not
//     an Error, one returns an answer whose getters throw, one answers about
//     another store — with every fault wired in by closure at construction and
//     none of them reachable through a label, an argument or an exported
//     constant. It is what makes the reader's own boundary reachable, and it is
//     a SEPARATE module precisely so no fixture surface answers a caller's label;
//   * with card 11's `store_ref:` line changed to a store its reader does not
//     serve, which must refuse with the gate's own answer and must NOT fetch;
//   * with the REAL store module kept and no connection configured, which proves
//     the unreachable refusals are the real code's, not a fixture's.
//
// What runs in all four is the real reader, the real ruling gate and the real
// derivation. The staging is how a store is stood in for without standing in for
// the reader, and it doubles as the check on the ruling table's own shape: each
// staging asserts it found Joe's three lines exactly once apiece before it
// touches them, so a line that drifted fails Part C on its anchor rather than
// silently proving nothing.
//
// PART D, THE PRODUCER SEAM IS NOT BUILT, AND IS NOT COPIED. Cards 9 and 10 have
// no ruling line, no reader and no restatement of their refusal anywhere in this
// slice — `emitGateZeroOutcome()` still says it, once.

 * by CALLING origin/main's own module, staged above at test time. Amendment 5
 * of 2026-09-12 is why they are no longer the literals an earlier round wrote
 * down: a test may exempt only values it PROVES stood on origin/main, and an

 * to assert delegation — that an unruled reader hands back its gate's object
 * whole, and that a ruled one does not. It seeds with the shipped gate's two
 * answers and takes on each staged tree's as that tree is built, because since
 * 2026-09-12 the gate binds these readers behind the same ruling table and a tree
 * with three null lines has a gate that answers differently from the shipped one.

 *                    line for card 11 fails on the id, before it reads a row.
 *   `unruled: true`  each line goes back to `decision_id: null,` — the shape src
 *                    carried before 2026-09-11 — which is how the null path is
 *                    still proved after the paste. It is a TEST-ONLY OVERRIDE

 *                    the file under node_modules/.cache, reached by importing
 *                    that copy's own reader. Nothing in src imports it, no
 *                    argument selects it, and no environment variable points at

// Each word is handed to each export in every argument position and, because a
// door does not have to be at the top of an object, as a nested KEY and as a
// nested LEAF. The same call is then made again with the word's TWIN — the same
// string with one character moved within its own class, so a 40-hex sha stays a
// 40-hex sha and a `sha256:` hash stays one, and no refusal moves because a
// pattern stopped matching. The two outcomes must be the same outcome.
//
// That comparison is what makes the claim falsifiable without an allow-list of
// answers: a module constant that appears in the answer appears in the twin's
// answer too and says nothing, while a word that came back BECAUSE THE CALLER
// SENT IT comes back as the twin instead, and the two disagree.

// PART E — THE CHECK NAME IS AN ENUMERATION READ OFF THE WORKFLOWS, NOT A SHAPE
// SOMEBODY IMAGINED.
//
// DEFECT 0c7bc84a. Card 13's validator was
// `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 ._/()-]{0,99}$/`, a character class with no comma in
// it, and the only check that guards main is named
// `main canary (gates, migration, types, freshness)`. The one name the reader
// exists to read was the one name it refused. `pg_dump -> age-encrypt ->
// artifact` was refused too, for the `>`. Nothing was broken about the reader's
// machinery; the validator had simply never been compared against a real name.
//
// SO THIS PART DERIVES THE SET A SECOND TIME, FROM THE DECLARING FILES, and
// asserts three things against that derivation rather than against the module's
// own list: every declared name is admitted, nothing else is, and the two lists
// are equal. The third is what makes the first two stay true — add a job to a
// workflow and this part goes red in the same commit, instead of card 13 quietly
// refusing the new check the first time anyone asks it about one.
