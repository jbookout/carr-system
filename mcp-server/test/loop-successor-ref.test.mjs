// loop-successor-ref.test.mjs — close-loop's successor_loop must accept the
// form a partner actually says.
//
// THE DEFECT, hit four times live on 2026-08-21 while consolidating the five
// markdown-endgame loops into one record. close-loop describes successor_loop
// as "the open row that carries the work forward", and its own missing-field
// refusal says "name the open loop that now carries this work". Both read as an
// invitation to pass the number. But the value went straight to resolveLoop as
// loop_id — the uuid-only branch — so "#213" landed in a where clause on a uuid
// column. Postgres raised invalid input syntax, and the caller got a bare
// `internal error` that named nothing: not the field, not the expected form,
// not even which of the two rows was the problem.
//
// That is the shape rule 3a9dbafd forbids (never make a partner decode an id)
// and the shape rule c53beeaa warns about from the other side: an error that
// teaches the caller nothing means the next session hits it too and cannot tell
// a server fault from its own bad argument. Recorded as defect 3eb1ad6d.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/loop-successor-ref.test.mjs
// (also picked up by `npm test`'s test/*.test.mjs glob).
