// V5-M01 durable clock-history store. Every test drives the REAL storage
// mechanics — identity derivation, row decomposition, whole-content
// reconstruction, digest recomputation, exact-prior compare-and-swap,
// idempotency binding, the append-only diff and the deterministic readback —
// against real kernel output produced by journey-one-clock.v5.js.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROVED HERE, so nobody reads more into a green run:
//   * PROVED: the store's own logic, over the non-durable reference journal.
//     The kernel is called for real; no deadline, status or event is
//     hand-written by this file except where a test deliberately tampers.
//   * NOT PROVED: anything about ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql.
//     It has never been executed — the local initdb is blocked and no remote
//     database was used as a workaround. The only mechanical claim made about
//     it here is textual: that it states every shared append invariant and
//     contains no ALTER or backfill. mcp-server/test/journey-one-clock-store-postgres.sql
//     is the proof that has to run against a database, and it has not.
//   * NOT PROVED: that ops.j1_clock_history_digest and this module compute the
//     same hash for the same history. Both are asserted to hash the canonical
//     serialization of the same twenty-field preimage, and the SQL side reuses
//     ops.portfolio_canonical_json, which migration 0496 already reconciles
//     against artifact-trust.js's canonicalJson — but a JavaScript suite cannot
//     execute SQL. It is the single most important thing to check first when
//     this rail is exercised end to end. The SCOPE key has exactly the same
//     status: a disagreement between ops.j1_clock_scope_digest and
//     journeyOneClockScopeKey would file one program's clock under two scope
//     keys, one per language, and the uniqueness both sides rely on would hold
//     over two different sets rather than one.
