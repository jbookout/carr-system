// Unit tests for the DoctorCRE v5 benchmark acceptance store.
//
// THE DATABASE HERE IS A MOCK, AND NOTHING IN THIS FILE IS EVIDENCE THAT
// ANYTHING WAS STORED OR ACCEPTED. `mockDatabase` records the statements the
// module issues and returns the rows the test hands it. That is enough to prove
// what the module SENDS, what it REFUSES, and what it refuses to send — and it
// is not, and is not treated as, a claim about durable behaviour. The
// transaction-scoped proofs against a real PostgreSQL live in
// benchmark-acceptance-postgres.sql, and NO benchmark has been accepted by
// running either file: acceptance fails closed on the unbound Gate Zero
// binding, which the last group below asserts directly.
//
// The strongest test in this file is the smallest: the acceptance verb issues
// ZERO statements. A refusal that happens after a query is a refusal that can
// be mistaken for an acceptance that nearly worked. That assertion survives the
// coverage binding becoming a real read, because Gate Zero still throws first —
// and it now means "nothing reaches the database while Gate Zero is unbound"
// rather than "nothing reaches the database", which is what the module says.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT REACH, named rather than left implicit.
// readMeasurementCoverageBinding is still private and still not injectable —
// deliberately, since an injectable reader is a configurable one — so it cannot
// be called directly from here. It IS now exercised, through the review path,
// which reads the attestation back through the same reader acceptance uses: the
// four refusals below drive it by handing the mock a record that does not hold
// up. What still cannot be observed here is that reader firing INSIDE THE
// ACCEPTANCE PATH, because Gate Zero refuses before it on purpose. That is a
// consequence of the ordering the module chose, not a gap in it, and
// benchmark-acceptance-postgres.sql covers the acceptance-side behaviour by
// calling ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_binding() directly.
