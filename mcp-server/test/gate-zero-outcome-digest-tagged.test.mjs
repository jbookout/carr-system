// THE TAGGED OUTCOME DIGEST, ASKED OF BOTH IMPLEMENTATIONS AT ONCE
// (2026-09-13, the third release candidate's refusal, finding 2).
//
// WHAT THE OUTSIDE REVIEW REFUSED. Accepted plan PLAN-a5059eb52474-v3 requires
// the recorded Gate Zero outcome digest to be
// `digest(["consumer-gate-receipt.v1", receipt])` — the canonical JSON of that
// exact two-element array — computed by ops.portfolio_canonical_json in SQL and
// canonicalJson in the gateway, BYTE FOR BYTE THE SAME PREIMAGE IN BOTH, and it
// names a plain `digest(receipt)` by either reader as a failure condition. The
// r7 amendment of 2026-09-13 (packet
// 4379c60e9a4fefbcf044f4bc5a34e5a95c90f77b9adf348b6da7475e17d5e6d7) declares
// that preimage in `receipt_payload_digest_rule` and says in its own words that
// a digest over the receipt alone does not satisfy it. The refused candidate
// computed the plain digest in all three places.
//
// WHY THIS FILE NEEDS A DATABASE. "The two implementations agree" is a claim
// about two canonicalizers, one written in plpgsql and one in JavaScript. A mock
// cannot hold it: a stand-in that called the JS function would agree with the JS
// function by construction. So the SQL side here is the function migration 0505
// actually installed, read out of the live catalog, and the JS side is the
// shipped module.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT ESTABLISHES, each executed rather than described:
//
//   1. AGREEMENT, over a receipt the REAL producer emitted inside a real
//      dispatched call, and again over a canonicalization-stress fixture whose
//      only job is to exercise the corners the two renderers could differ on —
//      key order, nesting, arrays, unicode, numbers, empty containers.
//   2. THE TAG IS LOAD-BEARING. The plain digest — the recipe 0502 shipped and
//      r7 now refuses — is computed on BOTH sides and asserted to differ from
//      the accepted value. A change that dropped the tag would make these equal.
//   3. THE TAG'S VALUE IS LOAD-BEARING. The live SQL function is lifted from the
//      catalog, its tag literal is moved by one character into a pg_temp copy,
//      and the result is asserted to differ from both the accepted value and the
//      JS value. A tag that drifted on one side only is a divergence, not a
//      quiet agreement.
//   4. AND THE UNTAGGED DIGEST IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE VERB. The seat's readback
//      is intercepted and the row's `outcome_digest` replaced with the plain
//      one; the verb must refuse by name with
//      `gate_zero_outcome_digest_divergence` rather than report it.
//
// IT SKIPS WITHOUT A DATABASE and REFUSES a database that is not loopback: case
// 4 commits to an append-only record, which is safe only on the throwaway
// database the migration class builds.
//
