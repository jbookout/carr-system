-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J102: transaction-scoped PostgreSQL proof for the CRE
-- lifecycle rail.
--
-- THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED. It is delivered as source alongside
-- ops/cre-lifecycle.candidate.sql, which is itself an unnumbered candidate that
-- has not been applied to any database. Nothing in this slice runs either file,
-- there is no new PostgreSQL gate executable and no inventory entry point, and
-- running this file is a separate act on a disposable database. Read every
-- assertion below as "what this fixture WOULD prove when run", never as a result.
--
-- EVERY FIXTURE ROW IS ROLLED BACK. No lifecycle subject, event, business
-- record, Salesforce reference or correction receipt survives running it, and
-- the last group asserts the tables are empty again before the rollback.
--
-- EVERY RECORD IS SYNTHETIC. Every client, assignment, property, deal, document
-- and reason below is unmistakably test data. Nothing here is a claim about a
-- real CARR client or a real transaction, and nothing here is a proposal of one.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE TWO DOORS, STATED FIRST BECAUSE THEY DETERMINE WHAT EVERY GROUP BELOW
-- PROVES.
--
-- ops.j102_apply_transition STILL REFUSES TO CREATE ITS OWN PRIMARY SUBJECT
-- (`j102_primary_subject_creation_refused`), because a created primary has no
-- committed row for the transition's own prerequisites, instrument kind and
-- prior-state conditions to be checked against. An earlier revision of this
-- fixture opened an assignment that way and called it a positive walk; it was a
-- bypass with a bootstrap's name on it, and the receipt's
-- `prerequisites_checked: false` was an honest description of a check that never
-- ran. Group P0 below proves that refusal is still in force, and it is the group
-- to read first: the arrival of a creation door must not have reopened it.
--
-- ops.j102_initialize_subject IS THE CREATION DOOR, and it is a different
-- function with a different half of the admission map. It creates exactly one
-- subject of one of three kinds -- a prospect relationship, an assignment under
-- an already ACTIVE engagement held by a CLIENT, a property negotiation under a
-- still-open assignment -- each in the earliest declared state of its kind, in a
-- shape the map fixes field by field, with its parents re-read and
-- compare-and-swapped under its own locks. It performs no transition and checks
-- no transition prerequisite, so it skips none.
--
-- WHAT THIS FIXTURE IS THEREFORE WRITTEN TO PROVE, AND THE PREVIOUS REVISION
-- COULD NOT: a POSITIVE WALK from a legitimate first row through the existing
-- evidence-bound transitions (group J), beside the refusals that were always the
-- reason the file exists — and, because that walk yields a committed assignment,
-- the target and event-detail checks (U1, U2) and the context-resolution checks
-- (J4) that were previously unreachable. Group I is the creation door's own
-- refusal matrix, and it is the one to read beside P0, because a creation path is
-- the obvious place to smuggle a later state past the evidence meant to establish
-- it.
--
-- "WRITTEN TO PROVE" IS THE EXACT CLAIM. NOTHING HERE HAS BEEN RUN. Every
-- sentence in this file describes what an execution WOULD establish, and until
-- somebody executes it against a disposable database none of it is evidence.
--
-- WHAT THE POSITIVE WALK STILL NEEDS, and what happens when it is absent. Q077
-- admits Client status on a signed effective ETL or an approved equivalent, and
-- the approval reader is private and always raises -- so the walk needs one real
-- F01 DOCUMENT. This file creates a synthetic engagement letter through F01's own
-- writer when it can, and SKIPS the rest of the walk with a notice naming the
-- exact reason when it cannot: a session that is not a verified partner (the
-- evidence association is partner-only), or a database without the four-argument
-- ops.f01_record_document. It invents no document, no approval and no seed verb,
-- and it creates no role.
--
-- THIS FILE CANNOT SEED A ROW DIRECTLY EITHER, and does not try: every J102
-- relation carries ops.j102_guard_direct_dml, which requires the write to arrive
-- through a registered ops.j102_* writer and refuses a raw INSERT from this DO
-- block regardless of who owns the table. B7 proves that refusal rather than
-- working around it.
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- WHAT THIS FIXTURE PROVES THAT THE NODE SUITE CANNOT. The Node tests run
-- against a scripted fake handle, which can prove which statements the store
-- issues, in what order, and with which parameters -- and nothing at all about
-- what PostgreSQL does with them. These are the properties that only a real
-- engine can answer:
--
--   S1  the append-only triggers, the direct-DML guard and the no-truncate
--       guard exist on exactly the intended relations
--   S2  direct INSERT is granted to nobody, and the private approval reader is
--       executable by none of the runtime role bundles
--   S3  the one-pending-Deal-per-Assignment partial index exists with the
--       intended predicate (Q078/Q095 structurally)
--   S4  BLOCK-2 and H5 structurally: a first-party record cannot be stored
--       without a typed subject binding and an author class, the four
--       partner-only record kinds cannot be stored with any other author class,
--       and the evidence->subject association relation exists with its pin-exact
--       unique index
--   S5  BLOCK-1 and both root corrections structurally: the three partner-only
--       transitions are partner-only in the database's own admission map, the
--       map carries an exact target and an exact event set for every transition,
--       and the writer really does consult all of it. Runs in every session,
--       including one with no principal.
--   S6  the admission map declares NO transition that creates its own primary
--       subject, read off the installed policy rather than off this file's prose.
--       (That property used to be called `j102_fixture_bootstrap_absent`, a name
--       that also meant "this fixture cannot obtain a committed assignment". The
--       second half is now false, so the label is retired rather than reused: one
--       name for two propositions, one of them stale, is how a stale reason
--       survives an edit.)
--   S7  HIGH-5 and HIGH-6 structurally: every event in the map declares its whole
--       nested payload and no derived kind, the writer carries every provenance
--       and citation refusal, the citations are compared against what the RECHECK
--       read, the receipt derives its coupled facts and decision refs instead of
--       echoing them, and both history relations carry the CHECK constraints that
--       are the floor beneath all of it. Runs in every session.
--   B5  an idempotent replay returns the committed outcome, and the same key
--       over a different payload refuses (proved on the first-party record
--       writer, which is the one writer this fixture can drive to a success)
--   B6  the append-only relations refuse UPDATE and DELETE for real
--   B7  direct DML outside a registered writer refuses for real
--   B9  a closing_settlement record with no actual closing date cannot be
--       stored at all (Q094 structurally)
--   B10 the private approval reader raises, so no approval can be manufactured
--       one layer down either
--   B16 H5: whichever half this session can prove -- a sponsored agent cannot
--       author a closing_settlement, or a partner-authored one carries its
--       author class on the row
--
-- AND THE TWELVE ADVERSARIAL GROUPS, which are the reason this revision exists.
-- Every one of them is a DIRECT call on ops.j102_apply_transition, holding
-- nothing more than the carr_writer EXECUTE grant. Every one of them SUCCEEDED
-- against some earlier revision of the writer:
--
--   P0  the primary-subject creation refusal, still in force in the transition
--       writer now that a creation door exists beside it.
--   A1  BLOCKER-2's reproducer INCLUDING the obvious fix's defeat -- the wrong
--       subject's evidence, with that subject added to the lock set so that a
--       membership check would pass.
--   A2  the primary-creation masquerade: a transition proposing to CREATE the
--       subject it claims to advance, which is how the previous revision was
--       seeded and which is now refused by name.
--   A3  Diagnostics naming a weaker operation to obtain a stronger transition,
--       and a transition that does not exist at all.
--   A4  The direct carr_writer bypass of a partner-only transition, behavioural
--       wherever this session is a sponsored agent.
--   A5  HIGH-1 and the event set in full: an event lying about its own bytes, an
--       event claiming a different transition, an event for an unrelated
--       subject, an EMPTY event array, an EXTRA event, and a plausible WRONG
--       KIND on a correctly bound subject.
--   A6  An empty manifest, an unregistered evidence kind, and real evidence
--       presented from the wrong source.
--   A7  An unrelated proposed subject, and two subjects of one kind.
--   A8  A coupled subject proposed as a CREATION by a transition that only ever
--       updates it.
--   A9  A coupled write sent as a SUBSET: the primary subject alone, with the
--       coupled subject the same transition must move left out.
--   A10 The whole coupled set present, and the EVENT set short by one.
--   A11 HIGH-5: a FULLY CANONICAL call -- real evidence, correct binding, correct
--       event, correct target -- whose subject envelope claims to have been
--       established by a DIFFERENT transition, or by no transition at all; a
--       second unchecked claim hashed into the same authoritative bytes; a
--       foreign stored-subject schema; a header naming a subject its own state
--       does not describe; and the same two shape defects on the history side.
--       PROVED behaviourally: all of them refuse before any state is read.
--   A12 M-3: a compare-and-swap operand map that is SQL NULL, and one that is a
--       JSON scalar. Both used to slip three named refusals in silence or raise
--       an unnamed cast error; both now name the attempt. PROVED behaviourally.
--   U1  The target-value rewrites -- a permitted field carrying an unpermitted
--       value, and a permitted field DELETED rather than moved. Both are decided
--       against the COMMITTED row, so until a creation door existed they refused
--       earlier, at the compare-and-swap, for want of an assignment, and reported
--       themselves unproven. THEY NOW RUN INSIDE GROUP J against the assignment
--       the walk legitimately creates and opens, and prove the target check.
--   U2  HIGH-6 and the nested-payload half, moved for the same reason: an event
--       of the right kind, on the right subject, in the right number, naming an
--       evidence reference the transition never rested on; a record citing
--       another assignment's authentic mandate; and a record citing nothing at
--       all. All three are decided against the evidence re-read under the lock
--       AND against the committed prior row, and all three now fire.
--
-- TWO PREREQUISITES, checked before anything is attempted, each SKIPPING with a
-- notice rather than failing -- the same shape work-portfolio-postgres.sql and
-- benchmark-acceptance-postgres.sql use:
--   * ops/cre-lifecycle.candidate.sql must have been applied here.
--   * domain.sql must have been applied here (the J102 rail calls its tenant,
--     canonicaliser, digest, instant parser, clock and principal rather than
--     restating any of them).
--   * The BEHAVIOURAL groups additionally need a session running as an admitted
--     principal, because every writer derives its actor through
--     ops.f01_context_actor_slug() and refuses any other session_user. This file
--     CREATES NO ROLE and grants nothing: minting one would manufacture the
--     identity the whole rail exists to derive. The STRUCTURAL groups need no
--     principal and run either way.
--
-- AND THE THREE GROUPS THIS REVISION ADDS:
--
--   S8  the admission map's INITIALIZATION half, structurally: three creations,
--       each with a fixed creation shape and a single event, none of them
--       requiring evidence, none of them creating an engagement or a deal, and
--       the writer that carries every one of its refusals. Runs in every session.
--   I1  the creation door's own refusal matrix, behaviourally: an unknown
--       initialization, a TRANSITION id offered to it, an operation that does not
--       perform it, a non-null operand (which is an update wearing a creation's
--       clothes), a relationship born a CLIENT, an assignment born under no
--       engagement, a forged provenance, and an event citing evidence a creation
--       cannot have rested on.
--   J   THE POSITIVE WALK, from a legitimate first row through the existing
--       evidence-bound transitions: a prospect is created, a synthetic F01
--       engagement letter is recorded and associated with it, the ETL transition
--       makes it a Client with its Engagement, an assignment is created under
--       that engagement and OPENED on its own mandate record, and a property
--       negotiation is created under the open assignment. Every prerequisite is
--       genuinely satisfied rather than skipped, and the group ends by proving
--       that the transitions afterwards still refuse without their evidence.
--   J4  The negative context cases the walk makes reachable: the CHAINED hop
--       resolving the relationship from the engagement's own field rather than
--       from whichever relationship a caller supplies, and the operand set closed
--       by IDENTITY rather than by kind. Both are direct calls on the creation
--       writer against real, locked, unmoved rows of the right kind. J4 also
--       NAMES the one context arm that is still unreachable here and why.
--
-- WHERE GROUP J RUNS IN FULL, since that is not the configuration every database
-- has: it needs a session running as a VERIFIED PARTNER (the evidence -> subject
-- association is partner-only) and either overload of ops.f01_record_document --
-- the six-argument writer from ops/document-derivative-registration.candidate.sql
-- is used when present, and domain.sql's four-argument form otherwise. Each
-- absent prerequisite is named in its own skip notice; nothing is invented to get
-- past one, and an F01 call that FAILS is a failure rather than a skip.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE, named rather than implied:
--   * The walk beyond the LOI draft. Submitting an LOI, recording a counterparty
--     acceptance, executing a lease and recording a commission all rest on
--     further F01 documents or corporate artifacts, and this fixture creates one
--     document rather than a library of them. Those transitions are proved by the
--     Node kernel suite against loaded evidence, and by the refusals here.
--   * ANYTHING AT ALL FROM GROUP J WHEN IT SKIPS. A green run is not evidence
--     that the walk ran: J3 onward sits behind a prerequisite check, and the
--     row-count assertions at the foot compare against counters the walk itself
--     increments, so they pass identically when the walk stops at the prospect.
--     Read the 'THE POSITIVE WALK RAN IN FULL' notice, not the exit status. When
--     it is absent, U1, U2 and J4 did not run either.
--   * `j102_required_context_not_met` -- the arm enforcing engagement_state and
--     relationship_state on a LOCKED row. No shipped door writes a non-active
--     engagement or a non-client relationship, so no case here can drive it; J4
--     names that rather than leaving it to be inferred, and the Node parity
--     suite covers the arm against the kernel instead.
--   * That ops.f01_digest_jsonb and artifact-trust.js's digest() agree on the
--     same record. Both sides are asserted to hash the canonical JSON, and the
--     SQL side reuses F01's canonicaliser, which domain.sql already reconciles
--     against the module -- but a rollback-only fixture cannot execute
--     JavaScript, so the cross-language equality remains live-integration
--     verification. It is the first thing to check when this rail is exercised
--     end to end.
--   * That the lock ordering in ops.j102_apply_transition prevents deadlock
--     under real concurrency. A single-session fixture cannot contend with
--     itself; the ordering is argued in that function's own comment and would
--     need a two-session harness to demonstrate.
--   * That two CONCURRENT creations of the same subject id resolve to one winner
--     and one refusal. Both sessions take the same tier-2 advisory lock on that
--     key before either reads, so the loser's null operand meets the winner's
--     committed row -- but one session cannot contend with itself.
--   * Anything about a real client, a real deal or a real Salesforce record.

  -- === J3: THE ETL LEG, against WHICHEVER F01 DOCUMENT WRITER THIS DATABASE HAS
  --
  -- ONE SYNTHETIC ENGAGEMENT LETTER, through F01's own writer. Q077's "active
  -- signed ETL" is these axes and no others: fully executed, effective and
  -- current. F01 remains the sole authority for all three; this fixture only
  -- records a document that carries them, and invents no approval and no role.
  --
  -- WHICH OVERLOAD, AND WHY BOTH ARE HANDLED. domain.sql ships a four-argument
  -- ops.f01_record_document and DROPS it as soon as the six-argument successor
  -- from ops/document-derivative-registration.candidate.sql is present, so on any
  -- database carrying the current document-source hunk the four-argument form
  -- does not exist. An earlier revision of this fixture gated J3 on that dropped
  -- overload alone, which meant the whole walk silently skipped on exactly the
  -- configuration the document slice targets. Both are probed by exact signature,
  -- the six-argument one first because it is the current writer.
  --
  -- THE PROVENANCE STATEMENT IS REAL, NOT A PLACEHOLDER. A synthetic ETL signed
  -- by a counterparty is an ORIGINAL first-party document: it is derived from no
  -- stored artifact, so it names no source, registers no derivative link and
  -- claims no producer workflow, and it carries the basis statement that answer
  -- requires. That is the honest shape for what this fixture actually has, and it
  -- is why this leg fabricates no artifact and no derivative coverage -- the
  -- writer's own answer says `establishes_coverage: false`, and nothing here
  -- reads it as anything else.
  --
  -- AND THE CALL IS NOT WRAPPED IN A CATCH-ALL. An earlier revision degraded any
  -- F01 error into "J3 SKIPPED", so a wrong envelope shape reported as a missing
  -- prerequisite. A prerequisite that is genuinely absent is named and skipped
  -- BELOW, before anything is attempted; once the writer is present, whatever it
  -- says is the result, and a refusal fails this fixture rather than muting it.
