// V5-J102 — the persistence tail, proved case by case.
//
// Everything here is synthetic and nothing reaches a real database, provider,
// network or filesystem. The store runs against a SCRIPTED FAKE HANDLE that
// records every statement and every parameter in order, so these tests prove the
// things a Node suite can actually prove about a persistence layer:
//
//   * which values are DERIVED and which are refused from the caller,
//   * WHICH STATEMENTS RUN, IN WHAT ORDER — the replay-before-state ordering in
//     particular, which is load-bearing rather than incidental,
//   * that subjects and evidence are LOADED and that caller pins are CHECKED
//     against the readback rather than believed,
//   * that the compare-and-swap operands and the evidence recheck manifest
//     actually travel to the database,
//   * that a failing write ROLLS BACK and does not report success,
//   * that a replay reports what LANDED rather than what a fresh evaluation
//     would say now.
//
// NOTHING HERE MIRRORS A RETURN VALUE BACK AT ITSELF. Every assertion is either
// about a statement the store issued, a parameter it bound, the order it did so
// in, or a refusal it produced without issuing a write — never "the fake said X
// and the store returned X".
//
// The things a fake cannot prove — real concurrency, real append-only refusal,
// real direct-DML refusal, real evidence movement under a lock — are the SQL
// fixture's job, and mcp-server/test/cre-lifecycle-postgres.sql asserts them
// there instead of them being claimed twice here.

// THE TRANSITION-EFFECT PARITY SUITE.

// The map above says which FIELDS a transition may move. That is not the same
// question as what it moves them TO, and the difference is the whole of the
// second root correction: a routine `open-assignment` may write
// `assignment_phase`, and `assignment_phase: "committed"` is a commitment
// performed without any of a commitment's evidence.
//
// So `subjects` and `events` in the admission map carry the EXACT result, and
// these tests prove the transcription by running the kernel and requiring the
// map to PREDICT its answer:
//
//   1. the kernel evaluates a real transition and returns proposed_state/events,
//   2. the map's own rules are interpreted against the same inputs,
//   3. the two must agree field by field and event by event.
//
// NOTHING HERE MIRRORS THE MAP AT ITSELF. The oracle is the kernel's evaluator,
// which knows nothing about the SQL; a map that drifts from it fails here.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE, said plainly: the interpreter below is a
// TRANSCRIPTION of ops.j102_expected_value and of the writer's comparison loop,
// written in JavaScript because no database is reachable from this suite. It
// proves the MAP is right. That the PL/pgSQL implementation of the same
// algorithm behaves identically is unexecuted, and is the SQL fixture's job.
