-- WR-000116 -- the measured proof for the notification-preference PAIR.
-- Run by ops/ci.sh's migration class.
--
-- WHAT ONLY A DATABASE CAN SHOW:
--   * that the READ returns the documented defaults for an actor with no row
--     and INSERTS NOTHING. The returned object is identical either way, so the
--     only honest evidence is a count(*) on ops.notification_preference taken
--     across the call. A JavaScript assertion on the answer cannot see this.
--   * that the compare-and-swap is the PREDICATED UPDATE. A stale base_version
--     must leave the stored version exactly where it was, which is a statement
--     about the row and not about the return value.
--   * that the FIRST SAVE against base_version 1 with no row lands at version
--     2. This is the only place where a version the caller was told (1) does
--     not name a row that exists, and it is the most likely defect in the pair.
--   * that a REPLAYED idempotency key returns the same result and moves
--     nothing -- proved through ops.notification_preference_write, which the
--     verb handler's own envelope would otherwise answer from its cache.
--   * that quiet_now is TRUE inside a MIDNIGHT WRAP-AROUND. A 22:00-07:00
--     window under a naive `start <= now < end` comparison is false at every
--     hour of the night and green in every daytime test. The hour is reached by
--     choosing the TIMEZONE in which the current instant is inside the window,
--     computed in this file's own SQL -- never by hard-coding a zone name that
--     passes for eight months and fails in one.
--   * that both functions reach carr_writer and carr_authority on the exact
--     argument types and reach neither carr_reader, nor carr_jobs, nor public.
--     A stale arity would name a different function and prove nothing.
