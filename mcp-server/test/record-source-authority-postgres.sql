-- V5-F01 persistence tail — PostgreSQL fixtures.
--
-- HOW TO RUN THIS. Never by hand against anything that matters. It is applied by
-- ops/record-source-authority-local-pg-gate.py against a DISPOSABLE local
-- database, after the parent-bound predecessor migrations and exactly one F01
-- successor have been applied. It creates no role, reads no credential, reaches
-- no provider and touches no legacy row.
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, and what it deliberately leaves to the gate:
--
--   HERE  Structure. Positive round trips for every stored record kind, the
--         refusal matrix, compare-and-swap, append-only history, direct-DML
--         refusal, wrong-principal refusal, idempotency substitution, corrupt
--         newest-row readback, and that public.record_source / public.document
--         are byte-identical before and after.
--
--   GATE  Independence. The byte-for-byte agreement between
--         ops.f01_canonical_json and the Node canonicalJson is asserted by the
--         gate, which feeds PostgreSQL bytes it computed in Node. The canonical
--         cases in section 2 below are the SAME cases the Node suite asserts, so
--         a drift on either side fails both, but the database is never allowed
--         to be the source of its own expected bytes.
--
--   GATE  Concurrency. Section 16 EMITS a two-sided race request rather than
--         running it, because one connection cannot race itself. The gate runs
--         the two emitted calls in two sessions and requires exactly one winner.
--
-- WHO RUNS WHAT. This fixture switches identity as it goes, because the schema
-- derives its principal from session_user and there is no other honest way to
-- exercise it. Section 0 blocks the run outright if the real principals are not
-- present. The map, section by section:
--
--   the applying superuser       0-3, 3.5.1, 3.5.5, 11, 12, 12.1, 14 (the
--   (the gate's --fixture-role,  ALTER TABLE halves), 15, 17
--    or the owner if none)
--   carr_authority_joe           4 (policy), 9 (holds), 3.5.2
--   carr_writer                  5-8 (evidence, proposals, derivative-source
--                                registrations, documents), 10 (deletion), 13
--                                (idempotency), 14 (the read halves), 16, 3.5.3
--   carr_reader                  3.5.4
--
-- Sections 11 and 12 run as the OWNER on purpose: a principal with no DML grant
-- proves nothing by being refused DML, so the guards are tested by the one
-- identity that could otherwise have written.
--
-- EVERY VALUE IS SYNTHETIC. "synthetic-", "SYNTHETIC-" and the repeated-digit
-- digests are unmistakably test data. No real account, native id, object key,
-- drive item, field owner, retention period or hold appears anywhere.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 0. Bootstrap, or block. There is no third option.
--
-- WHY THIS SECTION IS THE SHAPE IT IS. ops.f01_context_actor_slug() derives the
-- principal from session_user. It reads no GUC that could name an actor, so a
-- fixture cannot describe itself as Joe by setting one — an earlier revision of
-- this file tried exactly that, and under the shipped schema every one of its
-- writer calls would have refused with f01_principal_refused at the first
-- statement past section 4.2. The only way to exercise the real semantics is to
-- BE the real principals, which means SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, which means a
-- superuser session and four roles that already exist.
--
-- THE FIXTURE CREATES NO ROLE, by standing instruction, and it never weakens the
-- authorization path to accommodate a database that is missing one. If the
-- principals or ops.authority_actor_slug() are absent, this raises
-- F01 FIXTURE BLOCKED naming the exact missing piece and stops. A run that
-- "passed" by falling back to the schema owner would be proving that the owner
-- can do authority work, which is the precise thing the schema forbids.
--
-- WHAT THE GATE MUST SUPPLY. A disposable database in which:
--   * the connecting user is a superuser (SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION requires it;
--     role membership is NOT sufficient and is not checked for that reason).
--     THIS NEED NOT BE — AND SHOULD NOT BE — THE SCHEMA OWNER: the gate takes a
--     separate --fixture-role for exactly this one file, so that the owner it
--     makes every privilege proof about can remain unprivileged. Nothing here
--     requires the two to be the same login, and nothing here grants either of
--     them anything,
--   * carr_reader, carr_writer, carr_authority_joe and carr_authority_dell exist,
--   * domain.sql has been applied,
--   * THE CANONICAL AUTHORITY BOUNDARY IS ALREADY IN PLACE. That is
--     0161_control_plane_authority_boundary.sql, and it — not this fixture and
--     not domain.sql — is what defines ops.authority_actor_slug() as a SECURITY
--     DEFINER function over session_user returning 'joe'/'dell', revokes it from
--     PUBLIC, and grants EXECUTE on it to the NOLOGIN group role carr_authority.
--     Section 0 below reads that arrangement back, because F01 depends on three
--     separate parts of it and each part fails differently:
--       - the helper must EXIST, or the authority path refuses outright;
--       - the two authority LOGINS must be able to execute it (they are members
--         of carr_authority), because ops.f01_require_authority_principal is
--         CALLER-RIGHTS and reaches the helper as the login;
--       - the F01 SCHEMA OWNER must be able to execute it, because
--         ops.f01_context_actor_slug is SECURITY DEFINER and reaches the helper
--         as the owner. The F01 grant loop cannot supply this: the helper's name
--         does not match f01\_%, and this fixture grants nothing either.
--     A missing piece BLOCKS here, by name. It is never granted, worked around,
--     or resolved to the schema owner.

-- deriving the principal from session_user rather than from anything a caller
-- can set. This section proves that derivation directly, before any record
-- exists to confuse the picture, and it proves the negative case that matters
-- most: a session that CLAIMS to be Joe is not Joe.
--
-- SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, not SET ROLE. SET ROLE changes current_user and
-- leaves session_user untouched, so a fixture built on it would be testing
-- nothing at all — the schema would still see the superuser underneath and every
-- assertion below would pass or fail for reasons unrelated to the principal.

-- merely holds every privilege in the cluster. Owning the tables — or being able
-- to bypass every ACL over them — confers no standing to write THROUGH them,

-- These refusals name session_user, so they hold for the owner and for a
-- separate bootstrap superuser identically.

-- 16. THE RACE REQUEST — handed to the gate, because a single session cannot
--     prove a race against itself.
--
-- Everything above runs in one connection, so every compare-and-swap above is
-- decided against a database nobody else is touching. That proves the CAS is
-- CORRECT; it cannot prove it is DECISIVE. Two sessions arriving at the same
-- moment with two different, individually valid mutations of the same record is
-- the case that matters, and it needs two connections.
--
-- So this section emits the two calls rather than making them. They are:
--   * BOTH VALID. Either one, run alone against the state left by section 14,
--     would be accepted — correct sequence 3 off event_2, correct previous-event
--     digest, transition starting from the stored value, receipt binding both.
--     Neither is a straw man that would have failed anyway.
--   * IDENTICAL IN THEIR COMPARE-AND-SWAP. Same expected policy digest, same
--     expected current-state digest (state_v2). That is what makes them
--     competitors rather than a sequence.
--   * DIFFERENT IN EVERYTHING A WINNER WOULD WRITE. Different target value,
--     different version, different idempotency key — so the winner cannot be
--     mistaken for a replay of the loser, and the idempotency ledger cannot
--     quietly resolve the race instead of the CAS.
--
-- WHAT THE GATE MUST OBSERVE: exactly one accepted, and the other refused with
-- f01_stale_current_state. Not both accepted; not both refused; not one accepted
-- and one refused for some other reason. The advisory field lock serializes the
-- two, and the CAS — not the unique index, which would refuse with a constraint
-- name — is what decides the loser.
--
-- HOW TO RUN THEM: two concurrent sessions, each `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
-- carr_writer` with carr.acting_actor_slug set, each issuing
--   SELECT ops.f01_apply_observation(<the twelve arguments, in order>);
-- No pg_temp helper needs to exist in those sessions — pg_temp does not survive
-- the connection that created it — so every argument is emitted as a VALUE that
-- stands on its own.
--
-- THE TRANSPORT SHAPE IS RAW JSON VALUES, AND THE GATE DOES THE QUOTING. Each
-- element of the emitted array is the argument itself: a JSON string for a text
-- parameter, a JSON object for a jsonb parameter, JSON null for the absent
-- reconciliation item. NOT a pre-rendered SQL fragment.
--
-- An earlier revision of this file emitted quote_literal(...) fragments and
-- '{...}'::jsonb casts. The gate's race_statement consumes values and quotes
-- them itself — that quoting is the injection boundary and it is adversarially
-- tested there — so the pre-rendered form was quoted a second time: 'accept'
-- arrived as the seven-character string with its own quotes attached, matched
-- no transition, and the concurrency proof (the one thing in this whole slice
-- that only a real database can establish) never ran at all. One side has to own
-- the quoting; it is the side with the tests for it.
--
-- The assertions below pin the shape ELEMENT BY ELEMENT, by jsonb_typeof, so a
-- reversion to pre-rendered fragments fails here, in the file that changed,
-- rather than as a puzzling refusal in the gate's race harness.
