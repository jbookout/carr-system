-- DoctorCRE v5 durable role-description store: transaction-scoped PostgreSQL proof.
--
-- HOW TO RUN THIS FILE, exactly:
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f mcp-server/test/model-role-store-postgres.sql
-- after ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql has been applied to that database.
-- THAT CANDIDATE INSTALLS FRESH: it refuses, before any DDL, a database that
-- already carries ops.model_role_* relations or functions, and it holds no ALTER
-- TABLE, no ADD COLUMN and no backfill. So the database this proof wants is one
-- BUILT from the current candidate, not one an older copy installed and a re-run
-- was expected to bring forward -- re-running brings nothing forward, by design,
-- because deciding what happens to rows already stored is a migration's act. The
-- "installed shape" block below detects that drift by name rather than assuming
-- it away.
-- Run it TWICE to cover both halves: once as the schema owner, and once on the
-- retained system-authority partner's authority connection (session_user
-- carr_authority_joe), which is where the positive current-pointer path and the
-- acting-principal refusal separate. A carr_writer session is also a supported
-- run mode and is expected to reach the pointer writer only as a permission
-- denial; see the assertion at "the current pointer" below.
--
-- THE NODE CASES ARE A DIFFERENT FILE AND A DIFFERENT COMMAND. To reproduce
-- exactly the cases in mcp-server/test/model-role-store.v5.test.mjs:
--   cd mcp-server && node --test test/model-role-store.v5.test.mjs
-- `npm test` in that directory runs `node --test test/*.test.js test/*.test.mjs`,
-- which is the WHOLE repository suite, not this slice -- so a green `npm test`
-- is not a statement about this file's cases and must not be reported as one.
--
-- EVERY FIXTURE ROW IS ROLLED BACK. This file writes nothing that survives it,
-- creates no role, no actor and no extension, applies no migration, and makes no
-- provider or network call. It is a PROOF, not an install: it does not apply
-- ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql and cannot -- that file is candidate source
-- and landing it is a separate, reviewed act.
--
-- THE ROLE IS SYNTHETIC ON PURPOSE. "Reviewer" below is a fixture for the
-- MECHANISM. It is not a proposal of DoctorCRE's real Reviewer job description,
-- nothing in the module or the candidate SQL seeds a role, and no revision
-- recorded here outlives the rollback.
--
-- EXPLICIT PREREQUISITES, checked before anything is attempted. Each one SKIPS
-- with a notice naming what is absent rather than failing, and a skip is
-- reported as a skip -- this file never prints a clean run for assertions it did
-- not execute:
--   * ops.model_role_record_revision must exist. It does not until
--     ops/model-role-store.candidate.sql has been applied here, which has NOT
--     been done by the change that introduced this file.
--   * ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id and ops.portfolio_canonical_json (migration
--     0496) and ops.authority_actor_slug (migration 0161) must exist. This rail
--     reuses all three rather than restating them.
--   * public.digest (pgcrypto) must exist.
--   * One active NON-HUMAN actor must already exist, for the writer context.
--     This file CREATES NO ACTOR AND NO ROLE.
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, none of which can be shown by reading SQL text:
--   * the preimage rebuilt FROM THE STORED ROWS equals, jsonb for jsonb, a
--     preimage assembled independently in this file -- and both hash to the same
--     role_digest, over the bare object with NO domain tag
--   * list ORDER participates in the digest for skills, rules and evidence
--     requirements, and does NOT for the three reference sets: those are emitted
--     sorted whatever ordinals their rows carry
--   * NON-EMPTY TEXT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS IN JAVASCRIPT. All 25 code points
--     ECMAScript String.prototype.trim strips are empty to
--     ops.model_role_is_nonempty_text; U+0085 and U+180E, which it does NOT
--     strip, are not; a lone tab, newline, NBSP, BOM or Unicode space is refused
--     as a title, a mission and a skill, on the writer path and on a direct
--     insert; and text carrying LEGITIMATE embedded whitespace is stored
--     VERBATIM and rebuilds to the byte-identical preimage
--   * a version hole, an ordinal gap, a repeated content digest, a reused
--     idempotency key with different content, and a system-authority role class
--     are each refused, and a refused write leaves nothing behind
--   * update, delete and TRUNCATE are refused on all four relations
--   * a direct insert naming another writer is refused
--   * NAMING THE CURRENT REVISION IS NOT DELEGABLE TO A SHARED LOGIN. On the
--     partner's own authority connection, the pointer writer still REFUSES while
--     this transaction's acting actor is anyone other than that partner's own
--     active human actor -- which is exactly the sponsored-agent case, since
--     partner-authority.js routes codex, claude, joe-local and dell-local onto
--     the partner's login
--   * naming the current revision REFUSES for any session that is not the
--     retained system-authority partner's own authority principal, the pointer
--     ledger stays empty, and the current revision stays null -- no role becomes
--     current by default
--   * the current readback names the POINTER's authority class as
--     pointer_authority_class and carries no bare top-level authority_class, so
--     the pointer's system_authority cannot be misread as the role's declared
--     class, which is at preimage.authority.authority_class and is occupiable
--   * every revision entry reports the role contract version it was stored under
--   * the per-role advisory lock is actually taken, and both writers take it
--   * carr_writer can record a revision and cannot name the current one
--   * THE INSTALLED SHAPE IS THE ONE THE WRITERS DEPEND ON: the thirty named
--     constraints listed there are present on the live relations (the primary and
--     foreign keys the rail does not turn on are not all listed, and the block
--     says which it checks), acting_actor_id is NOT NULL,
--     the three non-empty gates apply ops.model_role_is_nonempty_text in their own
--     definitions, and nothing gates text with the space-only btrim()
--   * no relation here carries an occupant, a qualification, a grant or a
--     numeric floor column
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE, named rather than implied. Read this list
-- before treating a clean run as coverage:
--   1. THE CROSS-LANGUAGE DIGEST EQUALITY. Whether ops.model_role_digest and
--      model-routing.v5.js's defineRole produce the SAME hash for the same role
--      cannot be shown by a rollback-only fixture, which executes no JavaScript.
--      Both sides are asserted structurally to hash the canonical twelve-field
--      object with no domain tag, and the SQL side reuses
--      ops.portfolio_canonical_json, which migration 0496 already reconciles
--      against the module canonicalJson. A role preimage contains NO NUMBER, so
--      the number-rendering half of that reconciliation cannot arise here. The
--      string half remains live-integration verification, and it is the first
--      thing to check when this rail is exercised end to end. It fails CLOSED if
--      it is ever wrong: the writer refuses on the digest comparison rather than
--      storing a role the two sides hash differently.
--   2. THE CONTENT FREEZE ACROSS TRANSACTIONS. ops.model_role_content_guard
--      compares a revision's created_xid against pg_current_xact_id(), and
--      pg_current_xact_id() returns the TOP-LEVEL transaction id -- so inside
--      one rolled-back transaction every subtransaction shares it and the guard
--      cannot be made to fire. Its presence and attachment are asserted
--      structurally below; its behaviour needs two committed transactions, which
--      this file deliberately does not create.
--   3. CONCURRENCY. Two sessions racing a compare-and-swap needs two sessions.
--      What is proved here is that the lock is real and both writers take it,
--      and that the compare-and-swap refusals fire on their own terms.
--   4. THE POSITIVE CURRENT-POINTER PATH, unless this file is run on the
--      retained system-authority partner's authority connection. On any other
--      connection ops.authority_actor_slug() raises and every pointer assertion
--      becomes a refusal assertion. The block at the end reports EXACTLY which
--      assertions were exercised and which were not, by name.
--   5. THAT A HUMAN WAS PRESENT. To reach the positive pointer path this file
--      SETS carr.acting_actor_slug and carr.verified_human_actor_slug itself.
--      That is not a workaround -- it is the residual gap, demonstrated: those
--      are ordinary transaction-local settings, so any session holding the
--      partner's authority login can establish the same context. The
--      acting-principal binding closes the sponsored-agent flattening on the
--      RUNTIME path, where mcp.js's setWriterActorContext is the only thing that
--      sets them; it does not turn possession of a login into proof of a human,
--      and this file demonstrates precisely that rather than obscuring it.
--   6. THE STRUCTURE-CHECK HALF OF THE NON-EMPTY GATE, in isolation. The CHECK
--      constraints refuse a whitespace-only value at insert, so a revision
--      carrying one cannot be brought into existence for
--      ops.model_role_structure_error to then reject. That ordering is correct
--      and it means only the first of the two gates is observable here; the
--      second is asserted from source below.
