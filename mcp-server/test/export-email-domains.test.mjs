// export-email-domains.test.mjs — the verb that lets a second machine hold no
// database credential (decision 2026-08-19).
//
// WHAT THIS VERB IS FOR. ops/fetch-allowlist.py builds the egress guard's
// allowlist from two export views, and reading them directly needed
// CARR_DB_EXPORTER_URL. On Dell's Mac that was the ONLY thing requiring a
// direct connection, so the whole "should he get database credentials" question
// reduced to this one query. The verb answers it by handing back DOMAINS,
// aggregated in SQL — strictly less than the connection could reach.
//
// WHAT THE TESTS PIN, and why each one is a real failure and not a formality:
//   1. An address can never come back. The aggregation is the security
//      property; if a change ever selects the raw column, this fails.
//   2. One unreadable view does not silently shrink the answer. A quietly
//      short allowlist is indistinguishable from a correct one, and the guard
//      would start refusing real client domains with nothing to read.
//   3. Both views unreadable raises rather than returning empty. An empty list
//      written to disk would strip every client domain the guard trusts.
//   4. Per-source counts survive, because the caller reports "N seen, M kept"
//      per view and the union alone cannot produce that line.
//   5. The verb is read-only — no write flag — since a write here would make
//      the credential argument it exists to settle moot.
//
// Run with: node --test mcp-server/test/export-email-domains.test.mjs
// (also picked up by `npm test`'s test/*.test.mjs glob).
