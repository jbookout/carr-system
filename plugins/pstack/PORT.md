# pstack platform port

Lauren Tan's MIT pstack comes from `cursor/plugins`, commit `e43c7ee26e0038c6c1fa8380dd34ce86ff94cb2a`, directory `pstack`.
The supplied source inventory contains 161 files, including hidden manifests and binary assets.
`UPSTREAM.json` binds each original file by SHA-256. LICENSE and the Cursor manifest remain unchanged. The repository inventory declares the seven exact upstream raster paths as binary so its text scanner can inspect the remaining source; its checker stays unchanged. The path checker declares `plugins/pstack/skills/` as a vendored tree whose upstream directory depth is preserved. This is an explicit depth policy, not manifest authentication. `UPSTREAM.json` cannot grant exceptions elsewhere. Filename and unsafe-path checks still apply inside the vendored tree.

This port changes platform references only. Principles remain byte-identical.
Playbook text remains upstream apart from literal tool and path substitutions. CARR routing and merge overrides below govern execution of that text.
Each operational skill reads this file and `pstack-models.md` before its upstream body.
Original platform-specific statements below those pointers use the mappings here.
The setup result is committed. It overrides older model defaults without rewriting Lauren's defaults.

## Platform mappings

| ID | Upstream reference | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Cursor `Task`, `generalPurpose`, `Comment Sicko`, and `is_background` | Native same-session roles use Claude Code `Agent` or Codex `spawn_agent`, with the registered `poteto-agent` or `comment-sicko` file as the role brief. Native plugin agent names may carry `pstack:`. Every external-model seat, including headless Claude, Sol and Grok, routes through a named Model Room desk under Delegate routes. Preserve role, model, effort, family diversity and output ownership. A task that forbids delegation overrides upstream fan-out instructions. |
| M2 | `AskQuestion` and `allow_multiple` | Claude `AskUserQuestion` and `multiSelect`. Keep the original questions, choices, and meanings. Split a prompt if native option limits require it. On Codex, use its structured user-input tool with the same choices. |
| M3 | `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` and model picker | Read `plugins/pstack/pstack-models.md`, resolved from this installed plugin root. `/setup-pstack` updates that file through the ordinary source path. Available Model Room desk model/effort readbacks replace Cursor's entitlement list. Do not invent a model or silently change its family. |
| M4 | `cursor-team-kit` `deslop`, `control-ui`, `control-cli`, and built-in `create-skill` | These dependencies were absent from installed Claude plugins and the Claude, Codex, and agent skill trees. This port supplies minimal equivalents in `skills/`. They preserve scoped cleanup, real CLI control, Playwright UI proof, and skill draft/test/iterate. They are port additions, not Lauren's original implementations. |
| M5 | Cursor cloud agent, `environment: "cloud"`, `cloud_base_branch`, cloud URL/dashboard | A named Model Room desk with an owned worktree or clone at the exact base revision. Follow Delegate routes and verify desk model, effort, session, owned branch, head SHA, and result. This is local headless isolation, not a hosted VM. A workflow that specifically needs a separate machine remains unsupported until that environment exists. |
| M6 | Origin forge and `origin pr` | Resolve to `gh`, the existing upstream fallback. Preserve create/edit/view/check/thread semantics and all independent-review and stack rules. Merge and arming operations resolve through M13. Retained Origin examples describe the upstream alternative; do not execute them here. Graphite `gt` is a separate upstream dependency, not Origin. |
| M7 | Cursor `agent-transcripts`, `.cursor/projects`, message schema, pinned chat/sidebar, readonly stripping MCP | Use only the current workspace and named run. Claude JSONL is under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-workspace>/<session>.jsonl`; resolve the actual directory and session, never glob unrelated workspaces. Codex uses `ops/codex-history.py` with validated session, cwd, and transcript path. Parse the native record types; do not reuse Cursor's schema. For no-write readers use native read-only controls and read-only connector tools. Claude Agent has no Cursor `readonly` field; do not pass it or claim it strips MCP. Pinned/sidebar checks need observed native session state or the operator's evidence. |
| M8 | `.cursor/skills`, `.cursor/worktrees`, install `/add-plugin` | Project skills use `.claude/skills`; Codex discovery uses links under `~/.codex/skills`. Agent branches use owned git worktrees. `scripts/install.sh` registers this repository's local marketplace and installs pstack through Claude's CLI. No hand-written settings. |
| M9 | Cursor routines, `update_state`, `SendToUser` secret requests, `api2.cursor.sh` webhooks | `make-bot-ui` remains dormant for these operations. No equivalent routine state or secure-request contract was proven. The URL and procedure stay as upstream reference; no guessed endpoint, credential flow, or substitute backend. |
| M10 | Cursor `/loop` and built-in babysit | Claude's native `/loop` when available. For Codex/headless work, a coordinator supervises event wakeups and heartbeats, rechecks the unchanged exit predicate, and keeps the same decision trail. A single CLI invocation is not a persistent wake loop. Use the pstack Babysit playbook, not a client's similarly named built-in skill. |
| M11 | Cursor mentions in unchanged scripts, tests, lockfile, or package identity | Keep byte-identical. `cursor` pagination variables are data, not platform calls. GitHub reviewer identity `cursor` and `CURSOR_AUTOMATION_ID` remain necessary to recognize existing bot reviews. The package name is upstream identity. `worktree-audit.sh` still has Cursor transcript discovery; its transcript/pinned-chat advice is unsupported here and is not deletion authority. |
| M12 | Cursor documentation, provenance, generic UI terms, or other client-only claims | Keep attribution and historical names. Cursor mode/icon/reminder metadata has no proven native auto-load equivalent; the canonical AGENTS.md pointer supplies explicit routing; CLAUDE.md links to that policy. Capability claims apply only after native readback. Native-only operations with no equivalent remain dormant rather than being silently omitted. |
| M13 | Shipping and Autopilot merge or arming steps, including `gh pr merge` and auto-merge | The CARR merge contract in `ops/config/release-pipeline.v1.json` overrides the upstream playbooks. Enqueue the independently reviewed, verified exact head for the orchestrator's serial merge queue. The orchestrator owns merge execution through the release pipeline. Builders never merge, approve, force-push or enable auto-merge. Preserve review markers, Reviewed-SHA, forbidden-verifier checks and hosted CI; queueing is not proof of merge or release. |

## Delegate routes

Role names, requested models, efforts, and panel sizes come from the current `pstack-models.md`. Before dispatch, include the standing Model Room routing decision in the preflight judgment with Jev. Read the live desk registry and select a named Model Room desk whose observed model, effort and execution posture satisfy that role. Dispatch through the Model Room bridge, never through a direct model CLI or API. A native same-session delegate may be used only when it satisfies the requested route and the task permits delegation.

The initial requested seats are Sol `gpt-6.1-sol` at `xhigh`, Grok `grok-4.7` at `xhigh` (`fast` is a selection label), and headless Claude `claude-opus-5-5` at `max`. These are requested models, not claims about available desks. Verify the desk's actual model and effort in fresh readback before dispatch and verify its result and source revision after completion. Name the desk and observed route on the dispatch. If no desk matches, report that mismatch to the orchestrator; never silently substitute a model, reduce effort, change desk settings, or launch the CLI directly. Select the cheapest qualified tier where the role allows a choice.

`auto` and `inherit-parent` retain their upstream meaning for same-session delegates. An external seat still requires a named, verified Model Room route. Use read-only desks for no-write roles and owned worktrees for writing roles. Keep briefs as data, preserve output ownership and independent review, and follow the task's foreground/background constraint. No route authorizes new credentials, data deletion, production effects, or paid API work.

## Remaining platform limits

Benny is preserved outside the registered slash-skill directory, as upstream requires.
Its two workflows, trusted thread marker, immutable source coordinates, coordinator-only Slack writes, fail-closed capability checks, repeated UI proof, verify-only existing-fix route, and draft-only delivery remain intact.
Cursor's `/automate` discovery and draft editor, Slack action names, operation editing, model picker, and store paths have no proven equivalent here.
Creation and activation remain dormant. This port does not install a scheduler or substitute a CARR backend.

`orch frontier set` still requires Graphite, as its upstream code and tests specify.
Its other TSV/JSON bookkeeping and the GitHub `watch-pr` tool run on Bun unchanged.
This task neither installs Graphite nor changes that dependency. A `gh` forge mapping does not claim to replace Graphite's stack graph.
UI control uses the existing target project's Playwright harness. Native simulators, Cursor IDE control, and hosted-VM provisioning need separate proven adapters.
Skills with Cursor-only `paths`, `mode`, `icon`, `color`, or `reminder` metadata keep that source metadata; this port does not claim native autoload from it.

Claude Code 2.1.289 rejects an agents directory in `plugin.json` with `agents: Invalid string: must end with ".md"`.
The Claude manifest therefore lists the two files under `./agents` explicitly. The original Cursor manifest still uses its directory.
This follows the [Claude plugin manifest reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## Installation and verification

`bash plugins/pstack/scripts/install.sh` installs the user-scoped Claude plugin and Codex skill links only from the canonical main checkout, derived from Git's common directory. Feature worktrees, detached revisions and non-main branches refuse before any client effects. The canonical bootstrap checkout is retained independently of session worktree cleanup.
The global installation also exposes pstack in doctorcre-app sessions without changing that repository.
This PR delivers the source port and installer contracts. Pre-merge source acceptance uses isolated synthetic installation fixtures; it does not require activation of unmerged source in a user's clients. Live client installation is a separate post-merge activation step, owned by the orchestrator. The canonical-main guard must not be bypassed to satisfy a pre-merge review.

After the orchestrator merges this PR and synchronizes canonical main, rerun the installer there. It rebinds an existing `carr-local` source and retargets old pstack Codex links only after verifying that they belong to another worktree of this same Git repository. Preserve unrelated marketplace bindings and occupied skills. The installer re-reads the Claude marketplace after installation and refuses a stale source even when the CLI mutations exit successfully. Verify the marketplace source, Claude `readFromFolder`, and each Codex symlink before cleaning up the original installation worktree. If Codex's native plugin manager also has a local marketplace registration, rebind it through that client's supported registration workflow and verify its source separately; this installer manages Codex skill links, not native Codex marketplace settings. A merged PR alone does not prove the live bindings moved. Retain the original installation worktree until all live readbacks pass; source review completion is not an activation receipt.

`python3 plugins/pstack/scripts/port.py <upstream-pstack>` authenticates the upstream file set and compares every vendored byte against the finite port.
`--inventory` regenerates the two reference tables below. `--apply` reproduces only the declared platform substitutions and entrypoint pointers.
The installed table covers every match from `grep -rn "Task\b\|AskQuestion\|cursor" plugins/pstack/skills`, excluding generated dependencies.
Each row points to one source line and the mapping that resolves it. No platform reference is silently dropped.
