# Rule-delivery eval

Historical experiment: train/test were both used in selection. Preserve its
`historical-receipt.json` and runs as exploratory evidence. The current
`receipt.json` from main is preserved separately. Fresh final claims follow the
three-way procedure in `../README.md`; the historical report writer is retired.
Set `CARR_EVAL_SPLIT` to a fresh frozen manifest for tuning.
The frozen runner defaults to development, tags results by manifest membership,
and selects variants on development. It never loads final via its tuning loader.
Historical runs retain their train/test tags.

Measures the deterministic half of CARR rule delivery: which taught rules the
trigger and pack layer puts in front of a session at each prompt and each tool
call, with the Jev judgment switched off. It is the "skill triggering" case:
the score is coupled directly to the trigger text.

## What is replayed

| event | production code called |
|---|---|
| prompt | `ops/rule_trigger_delivery.advise` (compiled `prompt_regex` rows, always-on; ranking and binding stubbed to raise), then `lib/rule_delivery_preuse.semantic_delivery` |
| tool call | `hooks/rule-pack-preuse-reselection.py`: `_matches` (scheduled rail), `routed_rule_ids` (route rail, `ops/config/rule-routes.v1.json`), `matched_triggers` (compiled table), unioned as `process()` unions them and deduped per (rule, tool) inside a case |

Nothing is written to production logs or caches. `selftest.py` checks that.

## Inputs (all offline)

1. **Recorded traces.** `ops/fixtures/rule-delivery-eval/cases.v2.json`: 240
   paraphrased shapes of real session turns, subagent briefs, defects,
   notifications and log lines, each with dense hand-adjudicated gold. The
   repo's own split (30% held out per stratum) is kept.
2. **Recorded routine reads.** The `Read` calls in `ops/fixtures/real-replay/read-calls.jsonl`
   and recorded Bash commands whose segments are all read-only verbs target
   source/history paths with no review-time rule. Surface reads are positive
   review cases in `selftest.py`.
3. **Hand-judged hard cases**, `hard_cases.v1.json`: 33 cases, one sentence of
   justification each. 13 should-not-fire (routine reads, chatter), 7 near
   misses (trigger vocabulary without the action), 13 positives.

`split.json` freezes every case id to train or test before any edit;
`selftest.py` fails if it moves.

## Grader (programmatic)

* `expected` = gold, minus disputed, minus boot-delivered rules, restricted to
  rules the trigger layer owes (a trigger or path route, or pack-layer member).
  Hand-written cases carry their own `required` list.
* `recall` = delivered and expected over expected (micro over rules; macro over cases).
* `false delivery` = a delivered rule outside the case's full gold set.
* `tokens` = estimated tokens of the receipts the events would inject
  (receipt render replicated offline, chars / 4).

## Run it

```
python3 evals/rule-delivery/selftest.py                       # eval health checks
python3 evals/rule-delivery/run_eval.py --variant baseline --split all
python3 evals/rule-delivery/run_eval.py --compare baseline v3
python3 evals/rule-delivery/run_eval.py --verdict baseline v3 recall
python3 evals/rule-delivery/noise.py baseline
python3 evals/rule-delivery/explain.py                        # train split only
```

The round command and candidate verdict use development with a frozen manifest,
and train for historical runs.
Historical rounds v1-v3 used the test split to decide keep/revert; those test
intervals are descriptive, not untouched-holdout evidence. The frozen split
still protects future rounds. `explain.py` reads train only. The system is
deterministic, so run-to-run noise is zero; paired bootstrap intervals measure
case-sampling variation only.

## Not covered here

The Jev half (ranking and single-rule binding at `UserPromptSubmit`) needs a
live TypeSafe binding. `tools/rule-delivery-eval.py ... --jev live` measures it;
this eval leaves it alone.
