"""Every live judgment still ANSWERS, proven against answers known in advance.

WHY A SECOND CHECK, WHEN ONE ALREADY ASSERTS EVERY JUDGMENT HAS A CALLER.
Because having a caller is not the bar, and this session proved it twice in
one day. ops/jev_change_tolls.py was wired into the push hook with 2>/dev/null
on the invocation while writing its findings to stderr: called on every push,
printing to nowhere, and the wiring check was green the whole time. Earlier the
codebase scan read a response key that does not exist, scored 426 regions at
0.0, and reported a clean codebase -- again with every caller in place.

BOTH FAILURES LOOK EXACTLY LIKE SUCCESS, and that is the point. A judgment that
returns nothing is indistinguishable from a judgment that correctly found
nothing. You cannot tell them apart by watching. You can only tell them apart
by asking something whose answer you already know.

SO EVERY PROBE COMES IN A PAIR. A POSITIVE whose answer must be non-empty, and
a NEGATIVE whose answer must be empty. One alone is useless: a judgment stuck
at "nothing" passes every negative, and a judgment stuck at "everything" passes
every positive. Only the pair pins it.

WHAT THIS CATCHES that no other check in this repository does: a credential
that expired, a service that changed its response shape, output written to a
stream somebody silenced, a question edited until it stopped discriminating,
and a judgment quietly degrading while its tests -- which use recorded
fixtures, never the live service -- stay green.

LOCAL-ONLY, and for the same reason ops/config-as-code-selftest.py is. It needs
a live credential and a live service. A hosted runner has neither, so there it
would assert the absence of a thing that is absent by construction. The
credential is read from the environment and never printed.
