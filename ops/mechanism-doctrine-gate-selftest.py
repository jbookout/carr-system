"""Fixtures for ops/mechanism-doctrine-gate.py.

The gate refuses a new gate, hook or scheduled job that does not name the
doctrine section explaining it. These cases pin the four ways that goes wrong:
covering something it should not, missing something it should catch, treating an
unreachable doctrine store as a pass, and treating an unreachable store as an
EMPTY one — which would fail every declaration on a runner and get the whole
check switched off within a day.
