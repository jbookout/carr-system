"""nightly-capability-skip-selftest.py — an unprovisioned capability must SKIP.

WHAT THIS DEFENDS. bin/nightly.sh runs under `set -u`. Its credential loader
exports only the names it FINDS in ~/.config/carr/db.env, so a capability that
was never provisioned on a given Mac leaves its variable UNSET rather than
empty. Dereferencing it then does not fail the step — it kills the entire
shell, mid-chain, with no FAIL line, no `chain FINISHED` line, and nothing in
out/nightly.log to find it by. Every step after that point silently never runs.

That happened on 2026-08-17: the hardening that replaced backup-dump.sh's
neonctl owner-credential path with a dedicated carr_backup DSN landed in the
code while this Mac had no such DSN. The chain died between `vendor level
drift` and `encrypted backup`, taking the encrypted backup, the portability
mirror, the calendar archive and the config mirror with it. The scheduled 02:05
run escaped only because its checkout was 38 commits behind; the failure was
invisible until a run happened to be watched.

WHY IT SHELLS OUT. The artifact that matters is the SCRIPT AS INVOKED under
`set -u` with the variable genuinely unset. Reading the source cannot prove the
shell's behaviour, and an `export VAR=` in a test harness makes the variable
EMPTY, which is a different state from UNSET and does not reproduce the bug.

Each case runs a tiny zsh script that reproduces one shape in isolation, so no
case touches the real chain, the real vault, or any credential.

Exit 0 if every case passes, 1 otherwise.

# That guard existed because doctrine_mirror.py exited 2 on an empty
# DATABASE_URL, and 2 reads as FAIL. #387 moved the fix into the callee, where
# it belongs — one exit code protects every caller instead of one branch
# protecting one caller — and the guard came out again.
#
# So this now checks the PROPERTY the guard was standing in for, by running the
# mirror with no credential and reading what it returns. A test that pins the
# shape of a fix cannot survive the fix moving; a test that pins the behaviour
# does not care where it lives. That is the same mistake #380's gate made in
# the other direction, and this file should not repeat it.
