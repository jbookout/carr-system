"""Nightly watch: does every active rule still carry an admission contract?

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23). ops/rule-admission-audit.py is the whole of the
control-plane roadmap's Phase 1 exit condition, and until today nothing had ever
run it against Production. Run there it read 218 active rules with 4 admitted
and 214 carrying no contract at all. bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh now installs
the reviewed contract and reports the same numbers when a human runs it bare —
but a door only reports when someone opens it, and the gap reopens on its own:
the rule about autonomous finalization of planned delivery work was taught on
2026-08-21, sat outside the reviewed enforcement map, and nothing noticed for two
days. Every rule taught from now on reopens it the day it lands.

WHAT IT MAY READ. It connects with CARR_DB_JOBS_URL, the routine-scoped role the
unattended boundary already carries, opens a READ ONLY transaction before issuing
anything, and asserts it is running as carr_jobs afterwards. Migration 0285
grants that role exactly two columns of `rule` — id and status — plus the
ops.rule_admission select it already had. It can count active rules and it cannot
read one: an unattended job that never needed the doctrine text should not carry
a credential that can fetch it.

EXIT CONTRACT, the same one its sibling ops/control-plane-registry-drift.py and
the checks around it in bin/nightly.sh use:
  78  no routine credential configured — a SKIP, not a failed night
  0   ran; a gap is PRINTED, not raised, because it is a prompt for a human and
      a step that fails every night until someone acts trains people to stop
      reading the alarm
  1   the watch itself could not run — a wrong role, a missing grant
