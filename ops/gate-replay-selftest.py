"""gate-replay-selftest.py — proves ops/gate-replay.py cannot be satisfied
without actually running the gates, and that its leak guard catches every miss
the 2026-09-24 Opus review found.

WHAT IS PROVEN, and each is adversarial rather than a happy path:

  LEAK GUARD. One planted leak per miss the review listed (lowercase street
  address, "1.2M", "450k/yr", USD, "<Name> Orthodontics", "Dr Smith", person
  names, a name used as a JSON key, sk_live_, ghp_, AKIA, a database URL with a
  password) plus the originals. Each must be caught both by the pattern module
  and by the CI scan of a planted fixture file, including a leak hidden behind
  JSON escaping. Clean text and the replay session id must pass, and every
  committed fixture must scan clean.

  EXTRACTOR. A planted leak drops the WHOLE record (no field of it survives),
  session ids are rewritten, out-of-checkout edits and conversation-quoting
  advisories are never extracted.

  MANIFEST. A new hook file with no manifest entry, a wiring that config has
  and the manifest lacks (or the reverse), a changed matcher, and a wiring
  whose matcher selects no fixture all fail.

  REPLAY, on a miniature repository with the REAL hooks/hook-meter-run.py:
    * a behaviour change with no text change is caught; a comment-only change
      (even one that names the fixture directory) changes nothing, so a comment
      can neither satisfy nor fool the check;
    * every register maps to the right verdict (allow, announce, deny, ask,
      reopen), read from the wrapper's own telemetry line;
    * a crash, a timeout, and a write outside out/ each fail;
    * the clock is pinned and the network is refused inside the gate;
    * helper evidence comes from modules the gate process actually executed, both
      through sys.path imports and through spec_from_file_location;
    * the run never asks git about any ref beyond its own sandbox, so a runner
      checkout with no local `main` cannot turn it into a no-op.
