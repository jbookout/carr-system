"""gate-lifecycle-report.py — weekly lifecycle report for every wired gate.

    ./.venv/bin/python ops/gate-lifecycle-report.py [--days 7] [--json]

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. WR-000019 slice S5 asked for gate lifecycle
MACHINERY: a named failure class, a catch metric drawn from the gate's own log,
a review date, and auto-downgrade logic (quiet window -> announce -> two quiet
windows -> retirement proposal), plus a weekly report. It is deliberately built
on top of, not instead of, ops/hook-telemetry-rollup.py: that script already
answers "what did the enforcement stack cost, live" and carries the council's
retire-candidate rule (zero denies + catch-class owned elsewhere + hot path).
This script answers a different, longer-horizon question — for EVERY wired
gate, not just retire candidates: is it still catching anything, against the
metric its own metadata says to trust, and if it has gone quiet, what should
happen next. Same "report, never act" contract as the rollup: nothing here
edits ops/config/hooks.json, a gate's mode, or its wiring. A proposal is a line
in this report, not a side effect.

METADATA. ops/config/gate-lifecycle.json holds one entry per gate actually
wired in ops/config/hooks.json: {failure_class, catch_metric, review_date,
mode}. mode is enforcing|announce|shadow, matching hooks/hook-meter-run.py's
own register vocabulary (block/reopen vs announce vs silent) — see that file's
_register_from_output docstring for why the register is recorded directly
rather than re-derived from an exit code later.

CATCH METRICS ARE HETEROGENEOUS ON PURPOSE, because the gates are. Most fire
through hooks/hook-meter-run.py into the shared out/hook-telemetry.jsonl and
are matched there by hook filename; several (staging-attribution-gate.py,
completion-evidence-gate.py, map-architecture-gate.py, context-handoff-gate.py)
keep their own dedicated log where every row already IS the catch
("row_exists"); rule-pack-drift-gate.py's shadow-mode record needs a field
check (its 'missing' list non-empty); drift-claim-gate.py and
drift-assertion-gate.py are execve'd by hooks/run-record-gate.py before
hook-meter-run.py's own telemetry write ever runs (confirmed: zero rows under
hook=="run-record-gate.py" in the live stream), so their only trace is the
plain-text out/hook-guard.log, matched by regex instead of a JSON field. One
gate, context-handoff-gate.py, logs no timestamp at all in its rows — that is
reported as a genuine data gap (data_available: false), never guessed at zero.

Five true_positive kinds, evaluated by is_true_positive() below:
  row_exists     every (filtered) row in the window is a catch
  field_in       row[field] in values
  field_not_in   row[field] not in values
  field_truthy   bool(row[field])
  text_regex     (text logs only) the line matches `pattern`

THE DOWNGRADE RULE, exactly the shape WR-000019 S5 asked for. A "quiet window"
is a --days-wide window with zero true positives for that gate's own metric.
Scanning backward from the most recent window, count how many consecutive
windows are quiet (capped at MAX_LOOKBACK_WINDOWS so one very old gate does not
force scanning the whole log):

  mode == shadow                          -> never proposes anything. A
                                              shadow gate has no live effect to
                                              downgrade; it is pre-enforcement
                                              instrumentation, not a control
                                              with a blast radius to shrink.
  consecutive_quiet_windows == 0           -> no proposal (active).
  consecutive_quiet_windows == 1
    and mode == enforcing                  -> propose downgrade_to_announce.
    and mode == announce                   -> no proposal yet (needs a second
                                              consecutive quiet window).
  consecutive_quiet_windows >= 2           -> propose retirement, regardless of
                                              current mode (this supersedes the
                                              single-window announce proposal).

A gate whose metric cannot be windowed (data_available: false) never receives
a proposal either way — see context-handoff-gate.py.

REPORT, NEVER ACT. This prints a markdown table to stdout and appends one JSON
summary row to out/gate-lifecycle-report.jsonl. Neither write touches
ops/config/hooks.json, ops/config/gate-lifecycle.json, or any hooks/*.py file.
Promotion or retirement EXECUTION — actually changing a gate's wiring or mode
— stays a human/PR act, exactly like the rollup's retire-candidate rule.

COVERAGE CHECK. Every gate this script finds wired in ops/config/hooks.json
must have an entry in ops/config/gate-lifecycle.json (check:s5-lifecycle-
fields-present). A gap there is a real defect in this slice's own deliverable,
so — unlike the softer --strict budget check in the rollup — a missing entry
fails this script's exit code by default; there is no flag that silences it.
A gate-lifecycle.json entry naming a gate no longer wired is reported as a
stale-metadata WARNING instead, since a parallel slice (S3) may retire or
rewire a gate while this report runs; that case is not this script's mistake
to fail on.

NO NEW SCHEDULED JOB WIRED BY THIS SLICE. bin/nightly.sh (see its "step" calls,
e.g. line ~1261: `step "hook telemetry rollup (reports, never retires)"
./.venv/bin/python ops/hook-telemetry-rollup.py --days 7`) is where this repo's
existing scheduled chain is declared, and it runs NIGHTLY. This report is
WEEKLY by design (a "quiet window" is a --days=7 window), so the ready step for
a follow-up to add, gated to run once a week, is:

    step "gate lifecycle report (weekly; reports, never retires)" \\
        env CARR_GATE_LIFECYCLE_WEEKLY=1 ./.venv/bin/python \\
        ops/gate-lifecycle-report.py --days 7

guarded the way this repo already gates weekly-vs-nightly steps elsewhere in
bin/nightly.sh (day-of-week test around the `step` call), or as its own
launchd/scheduled-tasks entry alongside the others under
ops/config/control-plane-*.json. Deliberately NOT added in this slice: wiring
a new job is exactly the kind of "convert or rewire" action the S5 scope
boundary reserves for a follow-up, not for the machinery itself.
