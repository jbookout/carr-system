"""Offline suite for ops/jev_defect_class.py. No credential, no network, no spend.

THIS SUITE USED TO ASSERT THE BUG. Its first version had a class called
OneRequestPerClassTests, checking that the module sent one request per class and
that no request saw another candidate. That was the reranking rule applied to a
roster it does not govern, and the tests locked it in — a suite can make a
mistake permanent as easily as it can catch one. The shape is now a single
Choice over the roster, measured at 69% top-1 and 88% top-8 in one request
against 38% and 81% in 320, and the cases below guard the new shape.
