p1-integration-gate.py — PROGRAM 1's INTEGRATION CLAUSE, executable.

THE REQUIREMENT. Program 1's bullet list names three uses for the ephemeral
rehearsal lane: "ephemeral Neon branches for MIGRATION/INTEGRATION/RECOVERY
tests". Two of the three were covered before this file and one was not:

  migration  ops/p1-rebuild-gate.py — the committed schema plus every migration,
             loaded on Neon rather than on a container.
  recovery   bin/restore-rehearse.sh — an encrypted dump decrypted into a
             throwaway branch and reconciled against production. It branches
             PRODUCTION deliberately and by its own route, which
             ops/config/environments.json records as chosen; that is a different
             lane from this one and is not duplicated here.
  integration  NOTHING. This file.

WHAT THIS PROVES THAT THE REBUILD GATE DOES NOT. The rebuild gate proves the
SCHEMA stands up: the SQL loads, the migrations apply, the tables exist. It
never asks whether the APPLICATION works on what it just built. A schema can be
structurally perfect and still be unusable by the code that owns it — a missing
grant, a role that does not exist on a fresh branch, a sequence the app writes
through but the schema load left owned by the wrong role. Those failures are
invisible to `to_regclass` and fatal in practice. Permission-denied on a table
whose CREATE succeeded is exactly the shape found by hand on 2026-08-16, when
recording the first release candidate returned "permission denied for table
release" against a database whose schema was entirely correct.

So this reconstructs the environment the same way, then drives the system's OWN
entry points against it — a write and a read back through real code, not raw
SQL — and asks whether the answer that comes back is the one that went in.

WHY NOT THE SANITIZED FIXTURES. tools/staging-fixtures.py pins staging in the
file and takes no DSN argument, deliberately, so a fixture load can never be
aimed somewhere else. Rather than widen that surface for a test's convenience,
this gate generates the only rows it needs through the application itself, which
is a stronger assertion anyway: fixtures prove data can be inserted, a
write-then-read through the real code proves the system works.

THE GUARDS are deliberately a copy of ops/p1-rebuild-gate.py's rather than a
shared import, and that is a choice rather than an oversight. Each gate is
self-contained, so a refactor of one can never quietly weaken the other's
refusal to touch production. Duplication is the cheaper risk here.

  0. The target project is NOT production. Compared by pinned id, first.
  1. The created branch is not the project's DEFAULT branch.
  2. The branch endpoint is a different HOST from production and from staging.
  3. Work happens in a FRESH database, never the branch's inherited copy.
  4. Teardown deletes the branch by the id create returned, on every exit path.

Exit codes: 0 all assertions pass · 1 an assertion failed · 78 no Neon
credential in this environment (EX_CONFIG, the convention bin/nightly.sh and
bin/run-scheduled.sh already use for "not configured here").

Fixtures: ops/p1-integration-gate-selftest.py.
"""
# ci: runs-outside-ci — needs a Neon API credential and vendor branch create/delete, which CI has by construction and by choice not got
#
# WHY THIS CANNOT CARRY `# ci: db-gate` — the same reasoning as
# ops/p1-rebuild-gate.py, and stated here too rather than cross-referenced,
# because these two files keep their guards duplicated on purpose (see THE
# GUARDS above) and a reader who opens only one should get the whole answer.
#
# CI's db-gate lane supplies a DATABASE_URL for a throwaway local Postgres. This
# gate never reads that variable; it only SETS it for subprocesses it points at
# a Neon branch of staging that it creates and destroys. Handed CI's DSN it
# would look for NEON_API_KEY, find none, and exit 78 on every push.
#
# And a container would be the wrong substrate anyway. What this gate proves is
# that the APPLICATION works on the environment the rebuild gate just built —
# grants, roles and sequences as the VENDOR creates them. The failure it exists
# for is 2026-08-16's "permission denied for table release" against a schema
# that was structurally perfect. A local Postgres whose roles CI made itself
# cannot stage that failure, so passing here would mean less than nothing.
#
# WHAT ACTUALLY RUNS IT: the nightly chain, where its step is currently
# `bin/routine-admin-refusal.sh`, an unconditional exit 78, for want of the same
# provisioned Neon admin capability. Loops 497 and 499 carry that. Until it is
# granted this gate executes nowhere, which is a fact worth printing on every
# push rather than a marker worth faking.

        # 107 of 131: carr_jobs is a LEAST-PRIVILEGE role, so "can read
        # everything" is the opposite of correct and a gate asserting it would
        # have pushed the system toward over-granting.

        # The question worth asking on a reconstruction is FIDELITY: does the
        # environment the repo just built grant what production grants? A missing
        # grant makes a table unusable; an extra one is a privilege leak. Both
        # are divergence, and divergence is the finding either way. Checked
        # against the baseline rather than against the spec (rule a6e6ab4e).
