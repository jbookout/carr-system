"""ops/partner-ping-window-selftest.py — the buzz window must never swallow a
weekday buzz, and must never query the database when nobody is awake to act.

WHY THE WINDOW EXISTS (2026-08-18 cloud-usage audit). partner-ping wakes every
120 seconds, and its query was the last thing holding the Neon compute awake
around the clock — autosuspend needs five idle minutes and never got them. The
window skips the QUERY (never the wake, never the job) outside weekdays
07:00–19:00 local, on the same reasoning rule 236ca227 already states for the
partners themselves: weekends are off, and at 3am a buzz reaches nobody.

WHAT THIS FILE IS DEFENDING, and it is the promise rather than the saving:
Joe's 2026-08-03 ruling was that Dell must not "wait until my claude reads the
team board at some random time in the future" — a two-minute interrupt during
the working day. Every weekday-hours check below asserts that promise is
untouched. If a future tightening of the window breaks one of them, it has
taken back something a partner was told he had, and that is exactly the change
that should not pass quietly.

NO CLOCK MOCKING: in_buzz_window() takes the moment as an argument, so these
are real datetimes through the real function — no freezing, no monkeypatching.
The --scheduled flag's own plumbing is exercised as a subprocess against the
real script, with no DATABASE_URL at all: outside the window the script must
exit 0 having never asked for a connection, and inside it must reach the point
where it demands one. That difference is the whole behavior, and it is
observable without a database precisely because the guard runs first.
