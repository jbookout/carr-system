"""reachability-check.py — a declared control that no live execution path
references is not built, it is a file.

THE 2026-08-23 COMPLETION-INTEGRITY COUNCIL, fix D. Every gate this repository
owns asks whether a thing EXISTS. gate-integrity.py hashes all fifty hooks/*.py
whether or not any settings file names one. config-as-code compares plist BODIES
between the repo and the machine. The enforcement map records which control
implements which rule. Not one of them asks the only question that separates a
control from a text file: does anything CALL it?

So these sat in the tree, green, for weeks:

  hooks/ledger-boundary-sweep.py   Its own documentation has read "WRITTEN BUT
                                   REGISTERED NOWHERE" since the 2026-08-06 #214
                                   audit. Its docstring says it blocks; it blocks
                                   nothing. It is hashed in gate-baseline.json
                                   and named by the enforcement map, both of
                                   which made it look covered.
  ops/launchd/com.carr.fleet-sync  A plist no service in services.json declares,
                                   so no health row can ever mention it. Its
                                   failure is not `unknown`, it is unrepresentable.
  tools/sync-rule-admission.py     Until PR #529 its only caller was CI, against
                                   the disposable database CI stands up. CI proved
                                   the manifest and the schema agreed; nothing
                                   ever installed it in production, so there was
                                   no production door and therefore no drift for
                                   anyone to notice. bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh
                                   exists precisely to be that non-CI caller.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, and the constraint is the council's own: NOT a daemon, NOT a
nightly step, and NOT a reference graph over the whole repository. A graph that
counts a comment, a history file or a dead test helper as a caller never fails,
and a check that never fails is the disease it was built for. The inventory
below is the SPEC — four narrow lanes, each with a named source of declaration
and a named source of reference. Widening it is a decision, not a refactor.

  lane       declared in                     reachable when it is named by
  ---------  ------------------------------  --------------------------------
  hook       hooks/*-*.py                    ops/config/hooks.json (the global
                                             block the repo manages) or the
                                             project .claude/settings.json
  hook       hooks/*_*.py (helper modules)   imported by another hooks/*.py
  launchd    ops/launchd/*.plist             a service in ops/config/services.json
  installer  bin/install-*.sh, bin/sync-*.sh,  any tracked file that is not CI,
             tools/sync-*.py, hooks/install-*.py  not a selftest, and not an
                                             inert record
  registry   rule-enforcement-map.json's     its implementation files exist, and
             control_catalog                 at least one named hook is registered

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT READ: the machine. No launchctl, no ~/.claude, no
network, no database — the same standard the other inventory checks in ci.sh's
gates class meet, so it gives the same answer on a bare runner and on Joe's Mac.
The machine-state half of the launchd question already has two owners,
tools/scheduler-truth.py and ops/launchd-plist-parity.py, and this check does not
restate what they observe. It asks the repository-visible question those two
cannot ask on a runner: is this job declared to the fleet at all?

TOMBSTONES, and why one is not a mute button. An entry may be marked
intentionally-not-wired in ops/config/reachability-tombstones.json. The mark
must carry a REASON and a REOPEN CONDITION, it must name something that still
exists, and it stops applying the moment the entry becomes reachable — at which
point the stale mark is itself the finding. A completed lifecycle should leave
nothing behind pointing at it, and that has to hold for the exemption list too
or the exemption list becomes the next graveyard.

    ops/reachability-check.py                 # the report
    ops/reachability-check.py --json          # machine-readable findings
    ops/reachability-check.py --repo PATH     # measure some other tree

EXIT CODES: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the tree could not be read at all.
