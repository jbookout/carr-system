"""Prove the delivery tags actually install and actually select, on a disposable
PostgreSQL that carries the committed schema and every migration.

WHY AN ACCEPTANCE RUN AND NOT ONLY A SELFTEST. ops/rule-load-layer-check.py
proves the reviewed map is internally deliverable. It cannot prove that the
backfill writes what the map says, that the constraints refuse what the check
refuses, or that ops.rule_delivery_plan hands a session the set the council
designed. Those are properties of the DATABASE, and the only honest way to know
them is to run them against one (rule 937252fb: exercise the whole path before
saying a capability is live).

WHAT IT SEEDS. One active rule per id in the reviewed map, with a uuid whose
first eight characters ARE that short id, because that is how every surface in
this system derives a short id. No rule text is invented beyond a marker
statement: this proves plumbing, never doctrine.
