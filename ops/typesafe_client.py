"""typesafe_client.py — the one way CARR calls TypeSafe's Jev decision model.

WHAT JEV IS, because the shape decides how this file is written. Jev takes text
plus typed questions and returns calibrated probabilities. It does not write
text, produce code, or explain itself. Three question types exist and nothing
else: a yes/no probability (noul), a pick-one over a defined set (choice), and
a position on ordered levels (score). Code owns the workflow; the model supplies
the semantic judgment where ordinary code has none.

THIS FILE IS A LIBRARY ON PURPOSE. It carries no shebang and no main guard, and
it must never gain either. A .py file with either becomes a registered script
entrypoint in the sealed source inventory — see isScriptEntrypoint() in
ops/scac-mutation-inventory.mjs — which moves the frontier and owes a
forward-only registry successor. Callers are entrypoints that already exist.
Adding a shebang here turns a one-line import into a multi-file sealing cascade.

That detector is a REGEX OVER THE WHOLE FILE and does not know what a docstring
is, so writing the guard construct out even as an example — in prose, in a
comment, inside backticks — is enough to seal this file. The first draft of
this paragraph did exactly that and ops/typesafe-client-selftest.py caught it.
Describe the construct; never spell it.

FOUR THINGS THE VENDOR'S OWN DOCS SAY THAT THIS FILE ENFORCES RATHER THAN
TRUSTS A CALLER TO REMEMBER:

  1. ASK TOGETHER. Jev ingests the state once and evaluates every question
     against it in parallel. The published parallel-questions measurement put
     one batched request at 12.2x cheaper and 10.0x faster than the same
     questions sent separately, with no change in the answers. So `ask` takes a
     MAP of questions, never one, and there is deliberately no single-question
     helper to reach for by accident.

  2. KEEP ARITHMETIC IN CODE. jev-1.13 reads dates as text rather than as
     ordered quantities, and does not count reliably. Asking it which of two
     dates is earlier, how far apart they are, or how many items match is
     documented as unreliable. Extraction is a judgment and belongs here;
     comparison, duration, and totals are not and belong in the caller.

  3. TYPED IS NOT TRUE. The response schema guarantees the SHAPE of an answer,
     never its correctness — "cannot hallucinate" means it cannot emit an
     illegal type, and it can still pick the wrong option. Every caller needs a
     threshold and a fallback, which is why `decide` exists beside `ask` and
     returns an explicit escalate outcome rather than a bare value.

  4. FILTER FIRST. Accuracy falls as the state grows with content unrelated to
     the decision, and there is a hard ceiling besides. Retrieve and narrow in
     code, then send only the fields the question needs.

CREDENTIAL. Read from ~/.config/carr/typesafe.env, mode 600, outside the repo,
recorded by name in secrets-inventory.md. The value is never logged, never
echoed into an exception, and never written to a receipt. On an HTTP error this
module reports the status and a truncated response body, and deliberately does
not report the request it sent, because the request carries the bearer token.

AUTHORITY. Joe ruled on 2026-09-17 that CARR records, client and deal material
included, may be sent to third-party model APIs and admitted this vendor on that
basis. Network reachability is separate and already granted: both hosts sit in
KNOWN_HOSTS in hooks/guard-unattended.py.

    `state` is a string, or a mapping when the context has several parts —
    prefer named fields, and reference them from an instruction with backticked
    paths such as `ticket.messages[0].text`. `questions` maps a caller-chosen
    id to a question built by noul/choice/score; the ids come back unchanged and
    are never sent to the model, so the instruction must carry its full meaning.

    `facets` labels the judgments for diagnostic and historical receipt readers.
    It never imposes per-turn obligations. `transcript_path` optionally binds
    receipts to the dispatching human; otherwise the native session is discovered.
    Retries and late answers keep that owner. Unknown owners stay unbound.

    Returns the decoded response: {"model": ..., "answers": {...},
    "usage": {...}}. `opener` is for the offline selftest and is not used in
    production. On a successful response this also appends one best-effort
    receipt row to `calls_log` (default out/jev-calls.jsonl) — see
    JEV_CALLS_LOG's module-level note for what it carries and why.

    System-work calls probe the Worker's cache before reserving one paid Worker
    attempt. The explicit transport modes are validated before the Worker can
    fetch: an older Worker rejects them and the guarded direct route takes over.
    A failed paid Worker attempt retains its reservation before the direct
    transport. Runtime calls keep the pinned vendor route: the external Worker
    ingress derives system_work and cannot carry a caller-selected runtime class.
    Hook-internal calls remain direct. `purpose`
    distinguishes a normal call from the build advisory; `session_id` binds a
    hook's payload identity, and `server_runner` is an offline test seam.
    The Worker owns caching on that path; direct calls retain the local cache.

    `deadline` is optional: an absolute time.monotonic() value. With one,
    each attempt's timeout and each rate-limit sleep is capped at the time
    remaining, and no attempt or retry starts once it has passed — a caller
    under a hook timeout gets a TypeSafeError instead of a killed hook.
    `retries=0` turns rate-limit retries off entirely.

    `caller` names the invoking code in the usage log; if omitted it is inferred
    from the immediate caller file. Every real caller uses the shared 60s
    on-disk duplicate cache by default; a caller can explicitly pass zero.
    `account` names an account or organization when the caller has one. The
    credential hash also scopes the cache, including when no name is supplied.
    Cache hits return usage=None and cannot count as fresh vendor-call evidence.
    Paid attempts (including retries) are capped per UTC day by
    ops/config/jev-cost-guard.v1.json's required daily_paid_call_cap.
    Offline injected openers do not reserve paid calls or write live receipts.

    to a person or to a reasoning model rather than acting on it — the pattern
    every published build used, and the reason a typed answer is safe to
    automate at all.

    document. Treat any number here as a starting point to replace.

    Two cautions the docs make explicitly. A noul near 0.5 means yes and no are
    about equally likely, not that the answer is moderately true. And for a
    choice or score, confidence summarises how concentrated the distribution
    is — it is not a probability that the workflow is correct, and low
    confidence across several equally acceptable options need not invalidate a
    harmless preference.
