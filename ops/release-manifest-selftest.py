"""
release-manifest-selftest.py — the P0-1 rebuild clause, proven on every change.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM ops/p0-1-release-gate.py. That gate needs a
database and runs against the isolated staging project. This one needs nothing
but git, so ops/ci.sh picks it up automatically (it globs ops/*-selftest.py) and
every proposed change re-proves the rebuild clause. A check that only runs when
somebody remembers to point it at a database is a check that stops running.

WHAT IT PROVES

  1. DETERMINISM. Two builds of the same SHA produce byte-identical digests. If
     this ever fails, the digest has picked up something ambient — a timestamp,
     a path, a machine — and "identical artifact rebuild" becomes unfalsifiable.

  2. THE DIGEST IS OF THE COMMIT, NOT THE CHECKOUT. The digest of HEAD is the
     same whether or not the working tree is dirty. This repo regularly holds
     another session's uncommitted work (rule 308ef1de), so a digest that moved
     with the working tree would be worthless exactly when it matters.

  3. SENSITIVITY. A different SHA whose deployed paths differ produces a
     different artifact digest. A digest that never changes is a constant
     wearing a hash's clothes.

  4. VERIFY ROUND-TRIPS. A freshly built manifest verifies against its own
     recorded SHA.

  5. VERIFY ACTUALLY BITES. A manifest with a tampered digest FAILS verify. This
     is the seeded failure for this clause: without it, assertion 4 could pass
     because verify returns zero unconditionally.

  6. THE PLAN HASH COVERS WHAT AN APPROVER READS, AND ONLY THAT. Changing a
     material field moves it; changing a deploy-time observation does not. The
     database trigger that voids stale approvals is only as good as this hash.

  7. PROVIDER VERSION BINDING IS POST-UPLOAD, IMMUTABLE, AND APPROVAL-BOUND.
     It changes the plan hash without changing source evidence, and a bound
     manifest still verifies its source digests.

  8. THE MANIFEST CARRIES ALL SEVEN CLASSES the acceptance names.
