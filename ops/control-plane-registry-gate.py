"""Read back the canonical ledger registry and compare every tracked contract.

WIRED 2026-08-21. This gate was written, was correct, and had no caller: no
marker, no invocation anywhere in the repository. ops/ci.sh has been naming it
in the clear on every push since the db-gate loop was built — "db-gates without
the `# ci: db-gate` marker: control-plane-registry-gate.py" — and nobody read
the line. The control-plane roadmap's Phase 2 exit asks that every scheduled
run have an auditable owner independent of the AI provider's scheduler; this is
the check that asserts it, so Phase 2 could not exit while it sat unrun
(rule ab814a26 — a rule ships with its enforcement, and recitation is not
enforcement).

It needs nothing but the throwaway database the migration class already stands
up: verified passing there on 2026-08-21 against the committed schema, 25
workflows and 8 cognition contracts exact, zero legacy cutovers.

    Split out of main() on 2026-08-23 so the nightly drift watch and this gate
    run the SAME comparison instead of two that agree until one of them is
    edited (rule a8c55a47). Every statement here is a SELECT, so a caller may
    hand in a cursor already inside a read-only transaction under a routine
    role rather than the owner credential this gate's own main() uses.

    RESOLVE_MANAGED_ENABLED exists because the one authority-managed runtime bit
    lives in tables only the prebrief roles may read. A caller running under a
    routine role passes False: the receipt is not consulted, that single
    workflow's enabled bit is NOT compared, and its identity comes back in the
    fourth return value so the caller can say which check it did not perform.
    Reporting an unreadable input as a pass would be the more comfortable choice
    and the dishonest one.
