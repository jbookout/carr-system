"""worktree-attribution.py — name the worktree a foreign file belongs to.

WHY THIS EXISTS, from the incident rather than from theory. This Mac runs one
canonical checkout at ~/carr-system and, today, thirty-five registered worktrees
against it. A single untracked file in the canonical tree — `tools/dictation-rig/
vendor/quill`, which belonged to a session nobody could identify — refused
`git reset --hard` from ALL twelve tracked-clean worktrees at once. The refusal
listed the path and stopped there, so every session that hit it had the same two
choices: guess whether the file was safe to delete, or stop. Deleting another
session's in-flight work is the 2026-08-09 incident, so the honest choice was to
stop, and the Mac stayed blocked.

The council's move (2026-08-23 gates audit, ranked cluster R3) is not another
blocker and not a licence to delete. It is that the refusal must say WHOSE the
file is. "tools/… is dirty" is a fact a session cannot act on. "tools/… is
dirty, and worktree `festive-antonelli-56e0a8` has it too" is a fact that
routes: go ask that session, or read its branch.

WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT CLAIM. Ownership here is inferred from evidence on
disk, so every answer carries the evidence that produced it and its strength.
It reports `unknown` rather than guessing, because a confident wrong name is
worse than no name — the 2026-08-09 diagnosis was itself a wrong accusation, and
that cost the hour, not the missing files.

  certain       the path is physically inside a worktree
  dirty+content another worktree has it uncommitted AND byte-identical
  dirty         another worktree has it uncommitted (added, modified, untracked)
  branch        a worktree's branch carries the path and origin/main does not
  unknown       no worktree evidence; the file's mtime is reported instead

"ANOTHER WORKTREE ALSO HAS THIS FILE" IS NOT EVIDENCE, and an early version of
this script treated it as though it were. Every worktree is a full checkout, so
every worktree contains every tracked path; that test named a random peer for
every question and named it confidently. What actually distinguishes a session
working on a file is that the file is UNCOMMITTED in its tree — untracked,
added, or modified. That is the signal, and it is the one asked for here.

Usage:
    ops/worktree-attribution.py <path>...        # one line per path
    ops/worktree-attribution.py --porcelain <path>...   # tab-separated

Exit status is 0 whenever the question was answered, including "unknown". This
is a REPORTER wired into other gates' failure text; a reporter that fails the
command it was explaining would be worse than the silence it replaces.
