"""ops/stale-count-check.py — a count over an open-ended window goes stale.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Rule b01edd26 bans a hardcoded count a later edit can falsify.
On 2026-08-14/15 it was violated four separate times inside the ENFORCEMENT
LAYER, each needing its own pull request:

    hooks/drift-assertion-gate.py      "NINE times"
    hooks/drift-claim-gate.py          "8 times"
    ops/audit-queue-freshness-check.py "11 occurrences"
    ops/drift-assertion-gate-selftest.py "NINE times"

The ledger read twelve. The gate whose entire job is catching a stale figure
quoted as present state was quoting one, in the sentence written to persuade a
session to stop and check. A session that spots the wrong number has been handed
a reason to discount everything after it.

Three passes by hand still missed a fifth site — the same file, a different
wording. That is why this is a predicate and not a habit (rule 5e89c211).

THE DISCRIMINATOR, and getting it narrow is the whole design. A first attempt
flagged any quantity beside a countable noun: 173 hits across the repo, nearly
all ordinary prose ("it reads two version strings", "fired five times a week").
A baseline that size gets muted on day one, and a muted check is worse than none.

What goes stale is a count over an OPEN-ENDED window, still accumulating as the
system runs:
    "has failed nine times"     "11 occurrences"     "eight times since <date>"
    "currently 12 defects"      "now stands at 12"

What does NOT go stale is a count over a CLOSED window. "On the night this was
written he was right five times out of five" is true permanently.

THE DATE IS NOT THE DISCRIMINATOR, which was the first wrong guess. Every
damaging line carried one, because `since <date>` OPENS a window rather than
closing it. Narrowed to open-endedness, the same scan returns two hits.

QUOTED HISTORY IS EXEMPT. A line quoting a prior value while documenting its
correction is a record of the fix, not a live claim, and the number sits inside
quotes. A live claim never does.

RUN IT:
    python3 ops/stale-count-check.py            # whole repo, exit 1 on findings
    python3 ops/stale-count-check.py --path F   # one file
