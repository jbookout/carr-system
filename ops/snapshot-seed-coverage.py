"""Refuse a schema snapshot that cannot rebuild the database it was taken from.

THE TRAP, sprung six times before this file existed. A migration seeds rows. The
snapshot's ledger absorbs that migration, so on a rebuild it is already "applied"
and never replays. If the snapshot did not also carry the rows, the rebuilt
database has the table and none of its contents, and the failure surfaces days
later as a db-gate red in CI with nothing pointing at the cause. Each of the six
was then patched one table at a time, by hand, in bin/schema-snapshot.sh.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, and it is deliberately narrow: every table that an ALREADY
APPLIED migration writes rows into AT MIGRATION TIME must be CLASSIFIED in
ops/config/snapshot-seed-coverage.json -- carried, carried_subset, or explicitly
excluded with a reason. A table that is none of those is the next instance, and
the snapshot refuses to be written until someone classifies it.

WHAT "AT MIGRATION TIME" MEANS, and the first version of this file got it wrong.
It is NOT "appears in an INSERT statement in the file". An independent review of
the first version (2026-08-27) failed it on two blind spots that this repository's
own migrations already exercise:

  * DEFINE-THEN-CALL. 0247_system_rule_scope_binding.sql creates
    ops.sync_system_rule_control_bindings(), whose body inserts into
    ops.rule_control_binding, and then CALLS it at line 159. The first version
    stripped every routine body as "runtime code" and saw nothing in that file.
    A function body is runtime code only until the migration invokes it. So
    routine bodies are stripped, then put BACK for any routine the migration
    actually calls -- transitively, because a called routine may call another.

  * DML THAT IS NOT "INSERT INTO". CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT, MERGE, and
    COPY ... FROM all land rows and were all invisible. SELECT ... INTO is
    recognised only at top level, never inside a DO block or routine body, where
    PL/pgSQL's SELECT ... INTO assigns a variable and names no table at all.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose. It never adds a table to the snapshot and never
decides that a table deserves carrying. bin/schema-snapshot.sh's own rule still
governs that and is quoted here because this check is the thing most likely to
erode it: "a table qualifies because someone read its rows and can say what is in
them, never because a migration seeded it." Detection is not permission to
auto-dump. All this does is refuse to let an unclassified table pass in silence.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE CHECKED. A declared-carried table that has fallen out of the
artifact is the trap again, arriving by deletion. A declared-excluded table that
has APPEARED in the artifact is worse: business or runtime data entering a
tracked file, which is the one outcome the snapshot's whole design prevents.

READS THE ARTIFACT, NOT THE DATABASE. The applied-migration ledger and the data
statements both live in the snapshot being written, so this runs offline against
the candidate file: deterministic, testable without production, and true of the
exact bytes about to be committed rather than of a second query whose answer
could differ.

    and is not: truncation turns whatever preceded them into START OF STRING, and
    the pattern's own `^` alternative then matches where the full buffer refused.
    "E_b_cE\n" is one -- the real buffer has an alphanumeric before the final E so
    the test is false, while its last two characters "E\n" make it true. Python's
    `$` also matches before a trailing newline, which puts the interesting
    characters up to three back. A 300,000-case fuzz over both forms diverges 650
    times at two characters and zero times at three; four is that with margin.

    WHY THIS EXISTS AND IS NOT A MICRO-OPTIMISATION. The E-string test below looks
    at two characters, and used to reach them with "".join(top) -- rebuilding the

    WHY A SCAN AND NOT MORE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS. The previous version masked
    string literals with a pattern applied to text that still contained SQL
    comments, so an apostrophe in ordinary English prose paired with the opening
    quote of a real string and masked everything between them -- including the
    CALL that makes a routine body count as a seed. One apostrophe in one comment
    disarmed the check for that whole migration, and 102 of 264 applied
    migrations already have odd apostrophe parity. Found by the fourth
    independent review.

    You cannot find comments without knowing where strings are, and you cannot
    find strings without knowing where comments are. Alternating regular
    expressions will always lose that race; a single pass that handles both, plus
    dollar quoting, cannot. Literals are blanked rather than kept because a
    table name is an identifier -- no row-landing statement hides inside a
    string, and an `insert into` quoted in prose is not one either.

    Bodies are scanned too, not stored raw. A DO block or a routine body has its
    own comments and its own string literals, and leaving them unscanned put the
    apostrophe bug straight back one level down -- caught by the suite case that
    pins a signature inside has_function_privilege() as a name rather than a call.
