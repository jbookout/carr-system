"""V5-A05: daily cadence sweep -- detect a missed 14-day assurance receipt and
raise the "replan on miss" escalation.

Read-only against the record layer except for the ONE write this job owns:
raise-delivery-cadence-alert, called only when cadence-status (read) reports
status "missed". A subject that is "current" is left alone.
"no_receipt_on_record" is ALSO left alone while young -- but
ops.v5_a05_cadence_status (migration 0610) now starts the interval from a
genuine server-side activation anchor when no receipt has ever been issued,
so a subject that goes a full 14-day interval with zero receipts is reported
as "missed" too (review finding 3: "no_receipt_on_record forever" meant this
sweep could never fire for a subject nobody ever sends a receipt for, which
defeated the whole point). This script does not need to know that distinction
itself -- it only ever acts on status == "missed", from whichever reason_id
produced it.

Same call path ops/timebomb-audit.py and tools/cutover-watch.py use: a
subprocess to `run.sh call <verb> '<json>'`, never the generic MCP call-verb
passthrough. That path authenticates as the partner-sponsored local machine
credential -- the V5-A05 "system" seat -- so the write below is admitted; and
cadence-status runs on the writer connection in a read-only transaction
(writerConnection, PR #1236 review round 2 item 1), because
ops.v5_a05_cadence_status is not executable by carr_reader. The server
re-reads the cadence status itself before accepting the miss and derives
that a replan needs Joe's authority (held for his morning window); this
script sends no urgency or authority flag, because none would be honoured. No seal is owed for this script or its launchd plist (decision
05e144eb, 2026-09-24, PR #1174): script and launchd edits no longer reseal.

Bounded v1 scope: ONE subject, (engineering_program, doctorcre-v5) -- the
whole v5 delivery program's assurance cadence. Nothing in this repository yet
calls record-cadence-receipt to issue a receipt for that subject; this sweep
detects and escalates a miss honestly even while no receipt has ever been
issued (status: no_receipt_on_record is reported as such, never escalated,
since it is not a broken promise). Extending this to per-slice subjects, and
wiring a receipt-issuing producer, is a follow-up, named here rather than
silently assumed.
