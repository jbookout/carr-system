"""jev_fact_boundary.py — source-grounded claim checking at an output boundary.

WHAT THIS IS. ops/jev_done_checks.fact_check already asks Jev whether handed-in
doctrine passages support ONE claim, but nothing in production handed it any:
only its selftest called it. This module is the missing wiring. At two output
boundaries, a completion report (the Stop hook's final assistant message) and a
record-write acknowledgement (a record-layer write verb that came back ok), it:

  1. picks the consequential factual claims by DETERMINISTIC rules (select_claims);
  2. retrieves the current PERMITTED source passage for each one from the live
     doctrine store (search-doctrine, then one doctrine-sections batch read);
  3. asks Jev supported / contradicted / unsupported for every checkable claim
     in ONE batched request (one choice question per claim, per ops/jev_judge.py
     finding 1b);
  4. lets CODE decide what happens: pass, flag, or block (decide_claim).

NO EVIDENCE, NO CALL. A claim with no permitted passage is reported as
"no_evidence" and never sent to Jev: there is nothing to check it against, and
asking anyway would turn a model's guess into a verdict. If no claim has
evidence, the boundary makes no Jev request at all.

WHAT "PERMITTED" MEANS HERE. A passage grounds a claim only when it is:
  - a strict search-doctrine hit (a row marked provenance.fallback is the
    any-word best-effort lane, which search-doctrine itself labels "leads, not
    a confident match");
  - a section whose status is "active" (current, not retired or superseded);
  - not personal visibility (Life AI content does not ground CARR claims);
  - not carrying planted instructions (POISON). A poisoned passage is dropped
    whole, never trimmed, and named in the result so the store can be fixed.
The generated Drive files are never a source: they were retired 2026-08-19.

"BLOCK" IS A DECISION, NOT AN ENFORCEMENT. This module returns the decision.
hooks/jev-supervisor.py surfaces flag and block as advisory lines because the
2026-08-23 Stop-gate rationing leaves only three hooks able to reopen a turn,
and a record write has already landed by the time its acknowledgement is seen.
A caller that CAN stop something (a pre-write gate) reads verdict "block".

A LIBRARY, NOT A SCRIPT, for the reason ops/typesafe_client.py documents: no
shebang and no main guard. Every public function NEVER raises; any failure is
returned as verdict "unavailable" with the reason in detail.

THRESHOLDS ARE PROVISIONAL, named below, to be replaced from out/jev-judge.jsonl
once real traffic exists. The labeled fixture under
ops/fixtures/jev-fact-boundary/ measures selection, source filtering and the
decision policy offline; ops/jev-fact-boundary-selftest.py --eval --live
measures them against real Jev.
