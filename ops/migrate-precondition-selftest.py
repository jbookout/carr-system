"""The data-dependent-migration table is a precondition, never a skip-on-failure.

WHAT IT EXISTS FOR (defect 87da6fe5, 2026-08-22). Migration 0248 binds the
conduct-stop control to the autonomy rule, with an insert requiring that rule to
exist as `proposed` and a proof block that raises when the insert matched
nothing. That row exists in Production and nowhere else, so 0248 applied cleanly
to Production and then failed on the isolated staging project — which stopped at
206 applied while Production reached 209.

The cost was the whole release chain. The typed staging readback compares
staging's schema against a candidate's exact declared migration set, so it could
never match; the recovery rehearsal could not complete; and Production approval
refuses without a rehearsal bundle. The repository also stopped being able to
reconstruct a non-production environment, which is Program 1's rebuild clause.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, because the table is one edit away from being a door that
lets any red migration through:

  1. The probe runs BEFORE the file, not after it fails. A migration that errors
     for any other reason must still stop the run exactly as it did.
  2. A present precondition means the file APPLIES. The table must not turn into
     "never run 0248".
  3. An absent precondition records the file with its real sha256, so the ledger
     stays honest and validate_applied_ledger keeps working.
  4. Every entry names a file that exists, a probe that is a single read, and a
     stated reason. An entry for a file nobody ships is a stale exemption.

ALSO PINS (added 2026-09-24, after the pairing gap recurred twice --
0565/0566 on 2026-09-23, then 0575/0576 the very next day, fixed by hand in
PR #1193): any migration that is the FIRST in the tree to CREATE a
SECURITY DEFINER function or GRANT EXECUTE on one -- i.e. a live change to
the SCAC mutation catalog -- must be declared as an atomic pair with its
immediately-following `*_scac_successor.sql` seal in BOTH
ATOMIC_MIGRATION_GROUPS and STRICT_ATOMIC_MIGRATION_GROUPS. Left undeclared,
bin/migrate-prod.sh applies the domain file as its own one-migration batch,
and production's deferred SCAC epoch trigger refuses it at commit ("live
SCAC vNN mutation catalog drifted"). See test_new_authority_migrations_are_
atomically_sealed() and its seeded failing case below.
