loose-work-gate-selftest.py — acceptance test for hooks/loose-work-gate.py,
written before the gate (rule e65efc68).

WHY THE GATE EXISTS, in Joe's words on 2026-08-14: "why the fuck am i having to
tell every session to commit its work? this is insane."

He was right, and the mechanism is specific. Detection already existed —
tools/health-check.py reports loose tracked files — but it runs in the NIGHTLY
CHAIN, once a day, into a report somebody has to read, long after the session
that left the work has ended. So the human noticing was the fastest detector on
the machine.

Five hooks already run at Stop: conduct, completion-evidence, ledger-sweep,
context-handoff, scheduled-run-record. Every one of them checks what a session
SAYS. None checks what it LEFT. This is that one.

WHAT IT MUST GET RIGHT, which is mostly about what it must NOT do:

  1. ONLY THIS SESSION'S FILES. Several sessions share one working tree, and on
     2026-08-14 it held three loose files belonging to three different sessions.
     A gate that flagged all of them would make every session responsible for
     every other session's mess — which is how the nine-session broadcast
     happened, and strictly worse than the problem. The transcript names what
     THIS session wrote; nothing else is its business.

  2. SILENCE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING. This runs at the end of every session. A
     gate that speaks when there is nothing to say gets muted, and then it is
     not a gate.

  3. FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS. A missing transcript, an unreadable file, git not
     answering — none of it may strand a session. The failure mode of an
     over-eager Stop hook is a session that cannot end.

  4. AN ESCAPE THAT WORKS. Leaving work loose is sometimes correct: handing a
     tree to another session, or parking mid-investigation. Same idiom as the
     gates beside it.

Runs with no repo state of its own: every case builds a throwaway git repo and a
throwaway transcript.

# Joe, and his read was that a session had fixed it and the fix had not worked.
#
# Reachability matters more than any single upstream: the test is whether the
# commit is reachable from ANY remote ref, so pushing under a different branch
# name still counts as landed. That is how the same fix reached origin that day.
