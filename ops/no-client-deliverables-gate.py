"""Fail if any client-deliverable path is tracked (WR-000049).

Joe's ruling of 2026-09-03 is that the repository stays public, so the tree
must carry no client record. PR #868 removed the tracked client deliverables
that existed at the time (two Hughes dental pre-tour packets and the
Pensacola industrial pre-tour) and closed the .gitignore gap that let them
in. This gate is the durable half of that fix: it fails the push if a path
matching a client-deliverable shape is ever tracked again, whether it comes
back through a revert, a rebase, or someone dropping a new packet in without
reading .gitignore first.

The patterns mirror .gitignore's client-material block exactly, on purpose —
this gate and that ignore rule must never drift apart. See .gitignore for why
the patterns are deliberately generic (naming a client here would put the
identifier this rule exists to keep out into a tracked file).

Checks the COMMITTED tree (``git ls-files``), not the staged index: unlike
the pre-commit path-hygiene check, this is a pushfloor/CI gate answering
"does anything tracked right now violate the rule", not "did this commit
introduce a new violation".
