"""Rollback-only gate for the needs_joe -> triaged human answer door.

Exercises ops.answer_work_request_for_joe (migration 0575) end to end against
a real PostgreSQL, the same way ops/program6-human-triage-gate.py exercises
its sibling ops.triage_sourced_work_request (0175): a generic writer role is
refused, only carr_authority (as one of the two provisioned human authority
logins) may call it, the answering human is session-derived rather than
caller-supplied, the compare-and-swap refuses a stale version or the wrong
state, an empty-acceptance-criteria row is refused, scope_confirmed=false is
refused, an idempotency-key replay returns the same receipt without a second
transition, and reusing a key for a materially different answer is refused.
