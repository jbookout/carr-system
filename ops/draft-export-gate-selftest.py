"""draft-export-gate-selftest.py — fixtures for hooks/draft-export-gate.py,
written before the hook (rule e65efc68).

THE FAILURE THIS COMES FROM, 2026-08-15, defect 280b1b6c. Asked what was left on
Program 4, a session grepped out/exports/decision-history.md for "program 4",
found one unrelated line, and told Joe that a whole bullet had never been scoped.
It had been scoped four hours earlier. The draft file was THIRTY-TWO HOURS STALE
(2026-08-13 15:16) while the live vault render was five hours old, and the
determination the session missed was sitting in the live one.

WHY THE EXISTING BANNER DID NOT HELP. Every export already carries a header:
"GENERATED from the CARR record layer — do not hand-edit." That guards the WRONG
HAZARD. It protects the file from being written and says nothing to the reader
about the file being a stale draft. A `grep -c` never prints it anyway.

WHY out/exports/ IS THE TRAP SPECIFICALLY. It sits inside the repo, so it is the
natural thing a session reaches for, and it is gitignored, so nothing about it
travels or gets reviewed. `run.sh export` writes there as a DRAFT by default and
only CARR_EXPORT_LIVE=1 reaches the vault, which means the draft copy can be
arbitrarily old and never announces it. CLAUDE.md states this and three separate
tools carry a comment about it; none of that reached the moment of reading.

ANNOUNCE, NEVER DENY, and that is forced by evidence rather than caution: real
consumers read this directory on purpose. tools/calendar-touch-matcher.py and
tools/mail-touch-matcher.py both load the roster and registry from it, and
tools/parity-lead-board.py compares the draft against the live copy, which is the
whole point of a draft. A deny would break working code to prevent a reading
mistake.

WHAT MAKES IT ACTIONABLE is the AGE, not the warning. "This is a draft" is a
label; "this file is 32 hours old and the live render is 5 hours old" is the fact
that changes what the session does next.

Spawns the REAL hook with REAL PreToolUse Bash payloads against a REAL temp tree
with controlled mtimes. Exit 0 = allowed (this hook never denies); the assertion
is on whether it SPEAKS and what it says.
