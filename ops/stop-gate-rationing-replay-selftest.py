"""stop-gate-rationing-replay-selftest.py — replay the 2026-08-23 session shape
against the live gates, and score it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A PARAGRAPH IN A PULL REQUEST. Joe's acceptance
criterion for the Stop-gate rationing was not "the tests pass" — it was a
scoreboard on one specific, already-measured session:

    the five correct catches still catch
    the eight lint fires on reporting prose become zero
    the duplicate completion fire becomes zero
    reopens per shipped session drop by most
    nothing new can reopen without an admission card

That is a claim about the whole stack at once, and every individual gate's own
selftest can be green while it is false. So the claim is compiled here, and it
keeps running: the 48-hour test the council set is a bar this has to still clear
tomorrow, not a sentence somebody wrote today.

THE LEDGER BEING REPLAYED is in the council brief
(out/council/gates-audit-20260823/brief.md), where one real working session that
ran five councils and shipped three pull requests had every gate intervention it
experienced classified by hand: 5 CATCH, ~9 NOISE, 2 DEADEND. Grok's chair named
the target shape 5 : <=2 : 0.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said plainly so nobody reads a clean run as more than it
is:

  · THE TWO DEAD ENDS were harness-level — the Claude Code permission classifier
    denying a receipted incident close and then denying report-problem, the verb
    that exists so a session can file a block. No repo gate can fix or test
    that; the council's M1 assigns it to the classifier allowlist. It is out of
    scope here and stays at 2 until that lands.
  · THE DUPLICATE COMPLETION FIRE is now wired and is asserted here against the
    LIVE gate, not against the primitive. It was handed to busy-williamson-41dbc1,
    who built the widened gate (fix A), then handed the wiring back with the
    reason: hooks/stop_latch.py exists only on this branch, so an import from
    theirs would raise at module load — before main()'s try/except, so it would
    not even fail open — and two branches adding the same file collide in the
    gate baseline. Their branch is merged here and the latch sits on top of it.
    ops/completion-evidence-gate-selftest.py owns the detailed cases; this file
    asserts only that the duplicate is gone end to end.
  · NOISE IS COUNTED AS REOPENS, not as findings. Every demoted gate still makes
    its finding and still writes its audit row. What is being scored is what the
    session was CHARGED, because that is what the rationing changed.
