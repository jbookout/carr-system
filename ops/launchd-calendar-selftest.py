"""Proof for lib/launchd_calendar.py, the one StartInterval -> StartCalendarInterval converter.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On the Mac Studio (macOS 27.0) every LaunchAgent scheduled
with StartInterval sat at `runs = 0` with `pended nondemand spawn =
speculative|interval`, and even RunAtLoad never fired; StartCalendarInterval
agents fired normally. Fourteen CARR jobs were silently dead there. The fix is
to express every interval as a calendar schedule, and this file holds the three
things that fix depends on:

  1. THE CONVERTER. Every cadence CARR uses (60, 120, 300, 600, 900, 1800, 3600
     seconds) converts to the exact minute set, and an interval that does not
     divide the hour is rounded to the nearest divisor with a note saying so.
  2. THE TREE. No CARR LaunchAgent template carries StartInterval, and every
     template the converter rendered still matches what the converter would
     render now, so a hand edit to one minute array cannot drift silently.
  3. THE REFUSAL. A planted StartInterval is caught, and a StartInterval that
     only appears in a comment is not (the templates explain themselves in
     prose, and prose is not a key launchd reads).
