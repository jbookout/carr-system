"""ops/rule-classification-parity-check.py — the file map and the database
must agree about which rules are actually enforced.

WHY THIS EXISTS (WR-000019 slice S10, part 3). Two classifications of the same
219 rules have lived side by side with nothing ever comparing them:

  * ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json — a hand-authored, CI-validated file
    naming five categories (hard_pre_action, transactional_schema,
    post_action_verification, session_task_rail, judgment_advisory) and six
    finer enforcement_class values, synced INTO the database only by an
    explicit human running bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh --apply.
  * ops.rule_admission.enforcement_class — the database's own three-value
    classification (machine_enforceable, judgment_advisory, human_only),
    written by admit-rule/approve-rule, the only thing ops.applicable_rules()
    and every runtime enforcement check actually reads.

They have disagreed structurally roughly 4x over: the file inventories 218-219
rules, production has admitted only 4 (measured 2026-08-23). Nothing failed
when they disagreed, because nothing ever read both and compared them.

WHAT THIS CHECKS. It reads ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json (the file
truth) and ops/config/rule-admission-export.v1.json (a committed export of the
database truth — see bin/sync-rule-admission-prod.sh --export and
tools/export-rule-admission.py; that script is the ONLY thing that talks to a
database for this purpose). For every rule id present in BOTH, it normalizes
each side to the same two-bucket structure --

    machine_enforceable  <- file categories hard_pre_action, transactional_schema,
                             post_action_verification, session_task_rail
                          <- DB enforcement_class machine_enforceable, human_only
                             (both are actually gated; human_only just requires
                             a human authority act rather than a mechanical one)
    judgment_advisory     <- file category judgment_advisory
                          <- DB enforcement_class judgment_advisory

-- and fails on any rule whose bucket disagrees between the two sources.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never reclassifies a rule, never edits
either file, and never requires full coverage — a rule id in the file map with
no counterpart in the export is not a finding here (ops/rule-admission-audit.py
already owns "how many active rules lack an admission row at all"; that is a
DIFFERENT question from "do the two sides disagree about a rule they BOTH
classify"). This check compares only the overlap, honestly reporting how large
that overlap currently is so a shrinking export can never masquerade as full
coverage.

REPOSITORY CONTENT ONLY, no machine state, no database — same standard as
rule-enforcement-map-check.py and the rest of ops/ci.sh's inventory loop. The
export refreshes only when a human runs the sync door against production;
this check simply compares whatever the two committed files currently say.
