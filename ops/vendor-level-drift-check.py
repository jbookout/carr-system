"""ops/vendor-level-drift-check.py — surface where a vendor's recorded
relationship level and the countable evidence disagree.

THE RULE (faf1b643, Joe, after asking "what makes a relationship go from 0 to 1?
is it simply making an attempt to contact? or actually meeting with them? we need
to establish measureables for each level"):

    0 Prospective  identified, no two-way contact
    1 Building     the first TWO-WAY contact has happened — they replied, or you
                   met. An outbound attempt alone does NOT promote anyone,
                   because you can email fifty people and have fifty
                   relationships that do not exist.
    2 Established  value has moved in EITHER direction at least once — an
                   introduction, a referral, or a deal
    3 Core         reciprocal AND repeated — value both ways, more than once

THE LEVEL STAYS A HUMAN JUDGMENT and is stored, not computed: a relationship can
matter for reasons no event count can see. The rule says so in its own words, and
this check obeys it — it CHANGES NOTHING. It reports where the evidence and the
record disagree, in either direction, because both directions are worth a look: a
Core vendor with nothing passing between you for months, and a Building vendor
who has quietly sent three referrals.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The rule names its own mechanism — `v_vendor_level_suggestion`
— and that view has been in the database since migration 0052, refined through
0053 and 0065, and rebuilt in 0069 to exclude merged rows. Nothing outside the
migrations has ever read it. A view nobody queries is the failure rule d8c9b1f0
names: a finding that only exists in a record has not reached the partner.

WHAT COUNTS AS A DISAGREEMENT is the view's own `disagrees` column, which
requires BOTH sides to be known. A crude `recorded is distinct from suggested`
comparison reports 239 rows on today's data, and 243 of the 301 rows are simply
vendors with no evidence at all — mostly Prospective vendors correctly recorded
as Prospective. Reporting those as findings would bury the 16 that matter, and a
check that cries on day one gets muted on day one.

RUN IT:
    ./.venv/bin/python ops/vendor-level-drift-check.py
    ./.venv/bin/python ops/vendor-level-drift-check.py --json

Exits 0 whether or not it finds drift: the level is a human call and a
disagreement is a prompt, never an error. Exits 78 (house convention) with no
database credential, so an unconfigured environment SKIPS rather than fails.
