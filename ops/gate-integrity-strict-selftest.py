gate-integrity-strict-selftest.py — the acceptance test for gate-integrity's
--strict mode, written before the mode itself (rule e65efc68).

THE HOLE IT CLOSES, found 2026-08-14 by watching it happen. ops/ci.sh's gates
class runs hooks/gate-integrity.py and its own comment says "a gate edited
without a re-bless in the same commit (rule c0b38d80) fails here". It cannot.
gate-integrity.py returns 0 on every path INCLUDING the failure path, on
purpose: it is a SessionStart announcer, and a boot check that can wedge a
session is worse than the drift it reports. So the CI call could never fail,
and the class has been reporting "baseline integrity" it never verified.

WHAT THAT COST, the same day: pull request #102 was cut before #99 merged, so
its whole-file copy of the baseline knew nothing of the two gates #99 added.
Merging it overwrote main's baseline and dropped both gates plus one hash,
with CI green the whole way. The local pre-commit check added that morning
cannot see this — the overwrite happens in GitHub's merge, where no local hook
runs — so CI is the only layer that can catch it.

THE SPLIT THIS MODE DRAWS, and it is the whole design. Two kinds of problem
land in the same report today:

  CONTENT   a gate file's hash does not match the baseline, a blessed gate has
            vanished, a gate exists that nothing blessed. Pure facts about the
            repository, true on every machine and on a bare CI runner.
  ENVIRONMENT   live settings.json wiring, the Codex adapter, the vault-backed
            rule-enforcement map. All depend on a configured machine. A CI
            runner has no vault and no ~/.claude, and a worktree renders its
            own root into the wiring paths, so these are noisy exactly where
            --strict must be trustworthy.

--strict fails on CONTENT only. Anything that fails on a correct machine for
environmental reasons would get the flag removed within a week, and then it
protects nothing — the same argument the settings-change gate makes about
firing on reads.

WHAT MUST STAY TRUE, which most of this file is here to pin:
  1. Bare invocation still exits 0 with drift present. The SessionStart hook
     must never block a session, and that is not negotiable.
  2. --strict exits 1 when a gate's hash does not match the baseline.
  3. --strict exits 1 when a blessed gate file is missing.
  4. --strict exits 1 when a gate file has no baseline entry at all.
  5. --strict exits 0 on a clean tree.
  6. --strict still PRINTS the same report either way; it changes the exit
     code, never the words, so one reader serves both callers.

RUNNING IT. No database, no network, no production access:
