"""Hermetic checks for the workflow mode acceptance ladder.

Covers the three surfaces migration 0332 and tick --mode auto together own:
the DB guard's refusal branches (read as text; this selftest never touches a
database), the pure ladder resolver tick uses to pick a tier per workflow, and
the wrapper pinning the ladder-aware auto mode instead of a fixed one.
