"""hermes-memory-check.py — does the Hermes runtime's self-authored memory
contain anything the CARR record layer should own?

WHY THIS IS A PREDICATE AND NOT A SCHEDULED MODEL RUN. Joe, 2026-08-16: "that
drift check needs to be code, not a scheduled routine. we are going away from
claude running things that could just be code." Rule 5e89c211 says the same
thing in general: never spend a cognition token on state, recurrence, routing,
validation, or a decision already expressible as a predicate. Reading two small
text files and matching them against a fixed vocabulary is a predicate. A model
would cost tokens, vary run to run, and be unable to fail CI.

WHAT IT GUARDS. Hermes keeps two self-written memory files under
~/.hermes/memories/ — MEMORY.md (agent notes) and USER.md (user profile) — and
injects both into its system prompt at the start of every session. It writes
them on its own initiative: within hours of first install on 2026-08-16 it had
already recorded a UI preference nobody asked it to record.

The hazard is a SECOND RULE STORE. CARR's taught rules carry provenance, a
human activation gate, and a single source of truth. These files carry none of
that, are invisible to every CARR surface, go stale silently when the store
changes, and then steer the runtime against the store nobody knew it had
diverged from. That is a correctness problem rather than a security one:
Hermes cannot write to CARR (its profile's write set is empty), so its memory
can never BECOME CARR truth. It can only make the runtime behave as if it were.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not read, judge, or rewrite the content's meaning,
and it never deletes anything. It reports. Removing an entry is a decision about
what a runtime should know, and that belongs to a human or to a session acting
with one.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on findings. `run.sh health` reads the summary line.
