"""sync-enforcement-map-commit-selftest.py — prove the commit half behaves.

WHY. bin/sync-enforcement-map.py originally derived the enforcement map
correctly, re-stamped the baseline correctly, printed "COMMIT NEEDED" and
stopped. On 2026-08-13 it ran at 08:39, did its job perfectly, and left both
config files uncommitted; a session found them by accident hours later. An
unpushed gate change is the earlier outage in slow motion — the local machine
looks healthy while the repo and Dell's clone never receive it.

The commit half now exists, and it carries one genuinely risky behaviour: an
automated job that runs `git commit` in a tree that regularly holds ANOTHER live
session's uncommitted work. The guard is that it commits only its own two paths,
and refuses entirely if either was already modified when it started. That guard
is what this file tests, because getting it wrong means an unattended job
quietly commits a partner's half-finished work under a gates message.

Pure and hermetic: builds a throwaway git repo per case, never touches the real
one, and needs no network (the push failure path is exercised by having no
remote, which must leave the commit intact and report FAIL rather than crash).

THAT CLAIM WAS FALSE FROM THE FILE'S FIRST DAY UNTIL 2026-08-13, and case 0 now
tests it rather than asserting it. Two independent leaks, either one sufficient:

  1. GIT_DIR OUTRANKS cwd. `cwd=repo` is not isolation, because git reads GIT_DIR
     first — and every git hook exports it. ops/githooks/pre-push runs ops/ci.sh,
     which runs this file, so a plain `git push` made the fixture's own
     `git config user.email selftest@example.invalid` land in the REAL
     ~/carr-system/.git/config. The shared repo wore the test's identity.
  2. THE MODULE'S PATHS WERE FROZEN AT IMPORT. bin/sync-enforcement-map.py had
     MAP and BASELINE as module constants, so `mod.REPO = repo` redirected its
     git calls to the fixture while every read and write of the map and the
     baseline still went to the live checkout.

Both are closed: _fixture_env() strips the redirect variables, and the module
resolves map_path()/baseline_path() at call time. Loop #367.
