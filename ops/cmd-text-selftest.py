cmd-text-selftest.py — fixtures for hooks/cmd_text.py, the shared "tell a
command apart from the prose it carries" helper, written before its next
change (rule e65efc68).

WHY IT MATTERS THAT THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. cmd_text.py decides what two
gates are allowed to STOP looking at. Until now it had no direct fixtures —
only indirect coverage through each gate's own suite, which tests the gates'
verdicts rather than the boundary itself. A helper whose whole job is drawing
a safety boundary needs its own test, because both callers can keep passing
while the boundary moves underneath them.

THE CASE THAT DROVE THE CHANGE, 2026-08-14. The helper already treats a
heredoc body and a quoted `-m` message as data. It did not treat the other
flags that carry prose, so opening a pull request whose body DESCRIBED a
dangerous git command was refused as though it were running one:

    gh pr create --title "..." --body "...git stash drop <ref>..."

That is the same category error the module was written to end, arriving
through a flag nobody had listed. The workaround was to move the body into a
file — which is the outcome the module's own docstring warns about, because it
teaches whoever hits it that the gate is noise to route around.

THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES ON THE HELPER: it may only ever stop looking at
text the shell hands to a program as BYTES. Concretely, that means quoted
arguments to flags that carry prose. It must NOT stop looking at:
  · an unquoted flag argument (one shell word, cannot hide a command anyway,
    and matching it loosely would swallow real text after it);
  · anything inside `bash -c "..."`, `sh -c '...'` or a command substitution,
    which ARE executed;
  · a flag that merely starts with the same letters, like --body-file, whose
    argument is a path rather than prose.

Every ambiguity resolves toward scanning MORE, which is what the module means
by failing closed.

RUNNING IT. No database, no network, no production access:
