deploy-release-wiring-selftest.py — the deploy path names an approved release,
or it does not ship.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. P0-1 put the release object in the database and gave migration
0131 the teeth to refuse a production deployment that names no approved release.
None of that reaches a real deploy unless bin/deploy-worker.sh actually asks. So
this proves the wrapper asks, that a refusal happens BEFORE wrangler is invoked,
and that all three outcomes of a deploy reach the ledger.

WHY SOURCE ASSERTIONS AND NOT A FULL RUN. deploy-worker.sh refuses to run at all
unless the tree is exactly origin/main with a clean Worker directory and a real
wrangler binary — by design, and none of it is reproducible inside a test. The
house pattern for that shape is ops/backup-dump-selftest.py: assert the exact
command form in the source, and execute the parts that CAN run hermetically.
Here the executable part is the release preflight's own logic, exercised through
tools/ops-record.py with no database at all.

  1. THE REFUSAL PRECEDES THE DEPLOY. The require check appears before the
     wrangler invocation. A gate that runs after the ship is a report.

  2. THE REFUSAL IS A REFUSAL. Any non-zero result from the require check
     reaches `fail`; a ledger outage cannot become permission to ship.

  3. ALL THREE OUTCOMES REACH THE LEDGER. complete, verifying and failed each
     have a record_deployment call. A read-back belongs only to complete or the
     explicit machine-verified Production identity receipt.

  4. THE FAILED PATH RECORDS BEFORE IT EXITS. Recording after `exit 1` records
     nothing at all.

  5. THE MANIFEST IS BUILT BY THE ONE TOOL. The wrapper shells out to
     tools/release-manifest.py rather than carrying a second copy of the digest
     decision (rule a8c55a47).

  6. A source rehearsal's `release require` DEMANDS ITS SHA and refuses without
     one, so a staging wrapper that loses the variable gets an error rather
     than a pass. Production instead requires provider + immutable version.

  7. THE PRINTED ROLLBACK COMMAND USES THE PRODUCTION PROMOTION FLAG. Production
     no longer rebuilds a SHA; rollback approves and promotes a known immutable
     provider version through `--promote-version`.
