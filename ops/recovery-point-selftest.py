"""recovery-point-selftest.py — the checks that make ops/recovery-point.py worth
having.

THE ONE THING THIS MUST PROVE. The module exists because a two-state answer
(fresh / stale) produced a four-day false alarm while a twelve-hour-old backup
sat in GitHub. The fix is a THIRD state, and a third state is only worth
anything if it never silently collapses into one of the other two. Both
collapses are failures, in opposite directions:

  · unknown read as FRESH hides a genuinely dead workflow — the worst outcome,
    because it is the one nobody investigates.
  · unknown read as a GAP rebuilds the false alarm one layer up, and trains
    people to ignore the line.

So both directions get their own case, and neither is inferred from the other.

The cases drive assess() and the path readers with fabricated inputs rather
than the real filesystem or the real GitHub API: a check that needs the network
to run is a check that goes amber on a plane, and a check that reads the real
backups/ directory would pass or fail depending on the day it is run.
