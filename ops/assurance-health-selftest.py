"""Executable acceptance tests for the A01 assurance health projection.

These tests are deliberately provider-free, network-free and database-free: the
projection under test is a pure function, so every fact it needs is supplied
here as data.  They pin the decisions this module must make before any loader,
CLI or persistence phase is allowed near it:

  * the six display states, each reached only by its own evidence, and a
    deterministic precedence between them;
  * a matrix in which EVERY layer, degraded EVERY way the settled contract
    names, never renders green;
  * four preactivation receipts with four distinct exact identities, each of
    which independently blocks activation when it is absent, failed, stale,
    mismatched, self-attested or substituted;
  * an actual business outcome that is its own evidence slot and cannot be
    filled by completion enforcement_closure, merge/CI, enabled configuration,
    telemetry, activation, or a candidate-outcome pass;
  * one workflow degrading act -> draft -> read -> unavailable while an
    unrelated explicitly bound scope keeps its own evidence-derived state,
    byte for byte;
  * F09 workflow truth governing disabled, conflicting and not-operational, with
    no second workflow/status/receipt/incident registry anywhere in the module.

The workflow truth rows below are built by calling the real V5-F09 adapter, not
by hand: if the two modules ever disagree about a workflow's state, these tests
fail rather than paper over it.

    """THE TENTH REVIEW'S TWO PROBES, REPRODUCED, AGAINST THE DELETED ROUTES.

    PROBE ONE, THE ``__del__`` REBINDING.  The ninth cut's label route took a
    reading it did not use, ran ``del reading`` on it, and then read three
    module-level strings to build its answer.  ``del`` on the last reference runs
    the object's ``__del__``, which is caller code executing INSIDE the route
    between entry and those reads, and the review used it to get

        {"available": false, "reason": "caller_reason",
         "item_disposition": "verified", "owed_seam": "caller_seam"}

    out of a route documented as invariant.  The probe is reproduced here in full:
    an object whose ``__del__`` rebinds every name the old route read, plus the new
    frozen answer's own export, is built and dropped, and its ``__del__`` is
    ASSERTED to have fired and to have really landed those rebindings.  Then the
    route is called.  The bar is byte-identity with the answer captured before the
    probe existed, and object identity with the literal bound at import.

    PROBE TWO, THE SNAPSHOT REBINDING.  The review rebound the reader's
    module-level ``read_workflow_truth_snapshot``, which the old
    ``read_workflow_truth_reading`` resolved at call time, and got a caller's
    census printed by ``tools/health-check.py`` as the control plane's own answer
    -- "0 declared/registered workflow(s): 7 evidence-backed operational" -- which
    ``run.sh health`` shows.  The probe is reproduced by rebinding that name, the
    old render function's name, and the new frozen census export, all three on the
    live module, and asserting the census route does not move.  The same probe is
    driven through the real ``tools/health-check.py`` process in
    ``census_route_invariance_checks``, because a route is only as honest as what
    its consumer prints.

    WHY THESE CAN NO LONGER BE "CONTROLLED" THE OLD WAY.  The ninth suite proved
    each probe still worked before proving the route ignored it.  Half of that is
    now impossible on purpose: there is no minting function left to rebind, so the
    control asserts the rebinding LANDED ON THE MODULE (the attribute really does
    hold the caller's object afterwards) rather than that it changed a reading.
    That is the honest control for a deletion: the caller can still write whatever
    it likes onto these modules, and no route consults any of it.

# NO CARVE-OUT.  THERE IS NO ALLOWLIST IN THIS FILE ANY MORE.
#
# WHAT WAS HERE, AND WHY IT IS GONE.  The ninth cut carried an
# ``ALLOWLISTED_LITERAL_PATTERNS`` tuple: three strings the sweep was told to
# ignore when it found a union word inside them, because the route's own reason id
# was spelled ``reading_handle_integrity_unprovable`` and its owed seam was a
# paragraph of prose about READINGS.  The tenth review's finding was exact: remove
# the allowlist and the committed suite fails its own "read" test, so the green
# depended on the exemption.  An exemption a suite depends on is not an exemption,
# it is a hole.
#
# WHAT REPLACED IT.  The strings themselves were renamed until no union word
# appears in any of them -- ``handle_integrity_unprovable``, ``not_proven``,
# ``durable_signed_census_store_seam`` -- so the sweep runs over the whole closed
# union with nothing suppressed, nothing skipped and no filter on what it looks
# at.  The prose that used to be the owed seam's value is still written down; it
# lives in ``_OWED_LABEL_AUTHORITY_SEAM``, which is module-private and is not an
# export of anything.

      1. EVERY PUBLIC NAME of ``lib.assurance_health_sources`` and of
         ``lib.control_plane_workflow_truth_reader``.  Data values, not only
         callables: the ninth cut filtered the census to callables and so never
         looked at seven exported data values, several carrying "read" and one
         carrying "commit".  Each value is recursed into -- nested mappings by
         key, sequences, string leaves -- and the exported NAME itself is swept as
         a key, so a constant called ``READ_SOURCES`` is a hit even if its value
         is clean.
      2. EVERY CALLABLE among them, called with no arguments where the signature
         allows it, and with every caller-controlled shape positionally and under
         every plausible keyword where it does not; whatever comes back is swept.
         Classes are constructors and are called the same way.
      3. THE A01/F09 ROUTE THROUGH ``tools/health-check.py``.  That file is a
         SCRIPT, not a library -- importing it runs the whole health surface --
         and its module-level constants belong to unrelated legacy sections (a
         Drive path that contains "ok" inside a surname, a watch list describing a
         "human-review cadence").  So the scope swept here is the ROUTE, defined
         by a procedure rather than by exemptions: every string literal inside the
         two functions that print this slice's sections, AND every line those
         sections actually print in a hermetic canonical run with the tenth
         review's rebinding probe applied first.  Nothing inside that scope is
         exempt.

    WHAT IT ASSERTS.  For each of the twenty-eight words and each of the two
    patterns: the word never appears -- as an exact value, as a substring of a
    value, or as the name of a key set to ``True``.  Each check carries its own
    CONTROL, a synthetic structure holding the word in all three of those
    positions, so a word whose probe had gone dead fails its own test rather than
    passing quietly.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT SCAN, said plainly.  An exception is a refusal, not a
    returned outcome, so a raise contributes nothing -- a consumer cannot read a
    label out of a traceback.  And the private classification hook
    ``_would_be_assurance_health_if_authoritative`` is not an export and is not
    swept; the standing rule prescribes exactly that name for exactly that hook.

    """PARSER-BACKED, for the ADAPTER half of this surface.

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR.  ``public_surface_guard_checks`` parses
    ``lib/assurance_health.py`` and only that file.  While it reported green,
    ``lib/assurance_health_sources`` had no ``__all__`` at all and exported
    ``assurance_health_scopes(workflows)``, which validated a caller's census
    schema and each row's key and version and then returned THE CALLER'S OWN ROW
    back as ``workflow_truth``.  A review fed it a hand-written census and
    reproduced ``{"state": "healthy", "green": true, "capability_stage": "act"}``
    through that exported function.  A guard bound to one file of a two-file
    surface certifies the half it reads and says nothing about the other.

    WHAT IT PINS, in order.  (1) The module declares ``__all__`` and its public
    names are EXACTLY that list -- nothing is public by accident here.  (2) No
    public name carries a classifier, admission, fixture, snapshot or scopes
    shape.  (3) The two retired entry points are gone from the module under any
    name.  (4) The private classification names exist, start with an underscore
    and are unexported.  (5) NO PUBLIC CALLABLE ACCEPTS ANY PARAMETER AT
    ALL.  That is stronger than the ninth cut, which allowed exactly one -- the
    reader's own reading handle -- and it is stronger for a measured reason: the
    tenth review ran caller code INSIDE the route through the ``del`` of that
    unused parameter's object.  A parameter that is never used is not
    documentation, it is a window.  (6) Every caller-controlled census shape is
    pushed at every public callable positionally and under every plausible
    keyword, and every one of them is refused by the signature before a line of
    the route runs; nothing comes back at all, so neither a privileged string nor
    the caller's own sentinel can.  (7) The public entry is called for real, with
    nothing, and its answer carries no privileged string.  (8) A control proves
    the probe fires.

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, quoted from the review that found it.  Rebinding
    the reader's module-level ``read_workflow_truth_snapshot`` -- which the old
    ``read_workflow_truth_reading`` resolved at call time -- made
    ``tools/health-check.py`` print

        0 declared/registered workflow(s): 7 evidence-backed operational, ...

    and that line is what ``run.sh health`` shows a human.  The label route had
    already taken the fallback by then; this was the OTHER route, one surface
    further out, and it was still rendering caller content as the control plane's
    own answer.

    WHAT REPLACED IT.  The reader mints and renders nothing; both this surface's
    F09 section and its A01 section print one invariant unavailable line built
    from frozen literals.  This check drives the real script in a subprocess with
    all three names rebound -- the snapshot read, the render, and the frozen
    census export -- and every subprocess refused, then asserts:

      1. both sections printed;
      2. not one of the caller's strings reached the output;
      3. both sections carry the same reason id, the same ``not_proven``
         disposition and the same owed seam name;
      4. no count, no state and no census row is printed by either of them;
      5. the control -- that the rebinding really did land in that process, which
         is asserted by the probe itself failing to change anything only because
         nothing reads it, not because the write silently failed.
