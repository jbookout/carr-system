"""Reject newly staged paths that violate the file-shape rule (0e22e34a).

The check runs at the only point a bad repository path can still be refused
without rewriting history: pre-commit.  It examines additions, copies and
renames in the index, not the whole repository. Declared vendored trees
preserve their third-party directory depth;
established third-party trees
and historical filenames are not silently reclassified as a new violation.

The mechanical boundary is intentionally narrow and explicit:
  * no more than four directory components below the repository root;
  * no filename component using human draft/final-version suffixes such as
    ``_v2``, ``-v2``, ``_final`` or ``-final``. Dot-versioned machine
    contracts such as ``policy.v1.json`` are schema identifiers, not drafts.

``--paths`` accepts explicit additions for CI and the hermetic selftest;
ordinary use has no arguments and reads the staged index.
