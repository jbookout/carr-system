"""staged-gate-bless-check.py — a gate change carries its bless, or it does not
commit (rule c0b38d80). Called by ops/githooks/pre-commit; not a hook itself.

TWICE THIS WAS VIOLATED FOR REAL. 2026-08-12: a gate change landed without its
bless and main's baseline was later overwritten by a PR cut before it. 2026-08-14:
a live hotfix to settings-change-gate.py sat unblessed in the shared checkout and
every session that morning started under a GATE INTEGRITY FAILURE banner. Both
times the gate moved without the baseline and every later session had to treat
the enforcement layer as untrusted. The commit is the one moment the two can be
forced to move together, so that is where this stands.

WHAT IT CHECKS, against the INDEX, not the working tree — a partially staged
bless is exactly the ambiguity it exists to refuse:

  1. Any staged hooks/*.py (except *-selftest.py, which gate-integrity
     deliberately leaves unprotected) requires ops/config/gate-baseline.json
     staged in the same commit.
  2. The staged baseline's recorded hash must match the staged file bytes.
     Presence alone would bless the wrong bytes — the 2026-08-13 false
     re-bless — so the hash is verified, not assumed.
  3. The wiring contracts get the same treatment: a contract changes what the
     gates enforce without touching a hook, which is why gate-integrity hashes
     them too.

The contract list is duplicated from hooks/gate-integrity.py CONTRACTS on
purpose: this script must run inside selftest fixture repos that carry no
hooks/ directory, and a drifted entry here fails toward a false refusal, which
the escape hatch answers, never toward silence.

AUTO-APPLY, added 2026-08-23 by the gates-audit council. The INVARIANT above is
not the friction; the CEREMONY was. A session that changed a gate had to fail
this check once, read the remedy, run the bless, stage the result and commit
again — reliably enough that the miss has its own selftest. The baseline update
is fully determined by the staged bytes, so a human retyping it adds no
judgement, only a round trip.

So when the only problem is a baseline that does not yet record the staged
bytes, this now COMPUTES that baseline and stages it into the same commit,
rather than refusing and explaining. What it must not become is a rubber stamp,
so it is bounded in four ways:

  * It rewrites ONLY entries for gate files staged in THIS commit. Every other
    entry is carried forward byte-for-byte, so it cannot adopt another session's
    in-flight edit — the defect 320f5531 shape that scoped bless exists to stop.
  * It derives hashes from the STAGED blob, never the working tree. Blessing the
    working tree when the two differ is the 2026-08-13 false re-bless.
  * It PRINTS every entry it changes, old hash and new. A bless nobody can see
    is indistinguishable from drift.
  * It re-runs the verification afterwards and still refuses if anything fails,
    so the auto-apply cannot pass a commit the manual path would have stopped.

The co-change requirement is therefore unchanged: gate and baseline still move
in one commit, and hosted CI still verifies the committed bytes against the
committed baseline independently. What changed is who types it.

Opt out with CARR_NO_AUTO_BLESS=1 to get the old refuse-and-explain behaviour.

Exit 0 to allow, 1 to refuse (pre-commit relays the message), and 0 with a
warning if git itself cannot be read — an accident-stopper that crashes must
never become the thing that blocks every commit.

# PEP 604 annotations (`bytes | None`) below are evaluated at def time before
# Python 3.10 and raise TypeError there, which crashes this hook rather than
# failing the check it performs — so a commit is refused for a reason that has
# nothing to do with gates. Hit on Dell's Mac 2026-08-18, whose python3 is the
# macOS system 3.9.6. This makes the annotations lazy so the hook runs on both.
