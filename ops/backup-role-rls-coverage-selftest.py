"""The nightly backup must read every RLS-guarded row — contract + live proof.

bin/backup-dump.sh dumps with --enable-row-security (row_security=on) so the
carr_backup role's read of ops.work_request is not refused by 0324's RLS
(WR-000044, decision 11376c54). That flag trades a fail-CLOSED behavior for a
fail-OPEN one: with row_security on, a table whose RLS hides rows from
carr_backup is dumped SHORT and SILENT rather than erroring.

TWO LAYERS, one file:

  SOURCE CONTRACT (always, no database) — every table in public+ops with RLS
  enabled must carry a permissive carr_backup SELECT policy with no row filter
  (USING (true)); and bin/backup-dump.sh must carry --enable-row-security on the
  pg_dump line. Today ops.work_request is the only RLS table; 0475 adds its
  policy. This fails loudly the moment a future migration enables RLS on a
  public/ops table without a carr_backup read-all policy — before it can
  silently shrink the backup.

  LIVE PROOF (only when CARR_LOCAL_PG_DSN names a disposable PostgreSQL) — on a
  cluster with migrations applied, creates carr_backup (mirroring 0119, since
  db/schema.sql deliberately omits it — that omission was the original
  false-green), applies 0475, and proves: (a) the COMPLETE sealed SCAC v10
  census 4th block (roles+memberships+ownership, 0471's count=52/sha256:345871
  block) is byte-identical before and after the policy, with a BYPASSRLS
  positive control showing the SAME digest MOVES then returns — the census is
  bypass-sensitive but policy-insensitive; (b) row_security=off reproduces the
  nightly refusal and row_security=on gives full-row parity; (c) Joe's
  guardrails: carr_backup stays SELECT-only, NOSUPERUSER/NOCREATEDB/NOCREATEROLE/
  NOREPLICATION/NOBYPASSRLS, no bundle membership, zero write/DDL, no '^carr_'
  app role carries BYPASSRLS.

This is a *-selftest.py (not a *-local-pg-acceptance.py) deliberately: it is a
proof harness, not a wired mutation ingress, so it is excluded from the SCAC
script-entrypoint census (ops/scac-mutation-inventory.mjs isScriptEntrypoint)
and adds nothing to reseal. ci.sh runs the source contract; a reviewer runs the
live proof with a disposable DSN. Committed evidence:
ops/backup-role-rls-coverage-evidence.txt.
