"""egress-scope-selftest.py — proves guard-unattended.py blocks real network sends
and stops blocking commands that merely QUOTE a URL (loop #283).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, rather than a one-off check in a transcript. The old
send test matched the bare words `http` and `https`, which appear inside every
quoted URL, so any command mentioning a link was treated as egress. That fired on
the linkedin-engagement-daily run writing its own deliverable — a local file open,
a string concat, a write back — and refused it as "network send to an unrecognised
host (www.linkedin.com)". It would have fired on every run, because that routine's
SOP mandates a permalink per item.

Loosening a security guard needs a standing proof of what it still catches, not a
one-time eyeball. Run this after ANY change to the send logic:

    .venv/bin/python ops/egress-scope-selftest.py

A NOTE ON RUNNING IT. The cases below contain URLs on purpose. That is exactly why
they live in a file: putting them on a Bash command line makes the live guard scan
them as if they were the command under test, which is the bug this file is about —
it blocked its own first test run on 2026-08-13.
