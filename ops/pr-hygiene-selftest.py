"""ops/pr-hygiene-selftest.py — the acceptance test for ops/pr-hygiene-check.py.

WHAT THE CHECK IS FOR. On 2026-08-14 Joe asked the question this whole
mechanism exists to answer: if he stops reading GitHub's failure emails,
what notices that a pull request has been abandoned? Nothing did. A pull
request opened at 13:09Z that day sat eight and a half hours with no CI run
on it at all and a merge conflict against main, and it was found only
because a session went looking by hand. Its change was still needed and it
merged the same evening once someone rebased it.

The classifier below is the thing that would have caught it on a schedule.
It is pure: it takes the pull-request rows GitHub already returns and a
clock, and returns findings. No network in this file, so the test is
deterministic and runs on any machine including a CI runner with no
GitHub credential.

WHY EACH THRESHOLD IS WHAT IT IS. A red or check-less pull request minutes
old is a session mid-iteration, and flagging it would train everyone to
ignore this check — the alarm-that-fires-every-week problem the drift watch
comments warn about twice. The thresholds are set so a normal build loop
never trips them and an abandoned branch always does.

RUN IT:
