"""Hermetic checks that a LIVE export cannot resolve its vault root to the repo.

WHY THIS EXISTS. bin/routine-credential-env.sh runs every nightly step under
`env -i` and passes CARR_VAULT="${CARR_VAULT:-}", which is an EMPTY STRING when
the variable is unset — and it is unset under launchd. exporters/common.py read
that root with os.environ.get(name, default), which returns the empty string
rather than the default, so VAULT became Path("") and every path a LIVE export
called absolute resolved against the working directory instead: the repo.

Measured cost before the fix (2026-08-19 nightly run): two nights of exports
printed "ok — N rows -> DNA/... (LIVE)" while writing 126 files into untracked
~/carr-system/DNA and ~/carr-system/00_Context. The vault sat frozen at
2026-08-17 02:08 CDT, five generated files read STALE, 36 renders reported as
tampered (the recorded hash described the repo copy), and two export targets
failed to build against source files that exist perfectly well in the vault.

The three cases below are the whole contract: unset falls back, EMPTY falls back
the same way, and a real value is still honoured.
