"""ops/edge-liveness-selftest.py — prove the alarm fires, and prove what it
refuses to fire on.

WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. ops/edge-liveness.py returned green on its first run
against production and will keep returning green for as long as the Mac behaves,
which is most of the time. A detector that has only ever been observed agreeing
that nothing is wrong has demonstrated nothing at all — it would look identical
if `stale` were misspelled, if the criticality filter excluded everything, or if
the whole verdict were `return 0`. The alarm paths cannot be triggered against
production on demand without lying to the ledger, so they are triggered here
against fabricated rows through the REAL decision function.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TEST, said plainly: the SQL. assess() is a pure function of the
rows and this file hands it rows directly, so a query that selects the wrong
column would pass every check below. The query is exercised by running the tool
against production, which is done and recorded in the pull request; these checks
own the decision, that run owns the read.

Row shape, matching the query's select list exactly:
    (service_key, environment, criticality, runtime,
     freshness_state, health, observed_at, hours_since)
