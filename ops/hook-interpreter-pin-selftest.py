#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""hook-interpreter-pin-selftest.py — every wired hook names the repo interpreter.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS BECAUSE OF (2026-09-23). Every hook command in
ops/config/hooks.json began `/usr/bin/env python3`, and the desktop app hands
its hooks a PATH with no Homebrew entry, so that resolved to Apple's
/usr/bin/python3 — Python 3.9. Two gates are written against the 3.14 venv:
hooks/rule-pack-preuse-reselection.py imports a typing name that exists from
3.10, and hooks/settings-change-gate.py evaluates a 3.10 union in a signature
at import. Both died at import on EVERY call: 823 and 1,283 error rows in one
day's telemetry across six sessions, and nobody saw it, because a crashing hook
fails open and the telemetry keeps one line of the traceback. The effect was
that Jev's semantic rule delivery and build advisory, merged 2026-09-20, never
reached a session that day — while a terminal-launched session, whose PATH does
carry Homebrew, ran the same hooks on 3.14 and saw nothing wrong.

THE CONTRACT NOW. A hook command names `{{REPO}}/.venv/bin/python` explicitly.
PATH never chooses the interpreter, which is the same rule
hooks/run-record-gate.py already applies to the record-backed gates. The venv
is the interpreter every other part of this repo already requires (run.sh,
nightly, migrate, health), Dell's migration builds and version-checks it, and
bin/worktree.sh links it into every worktree. A tree with no venv therefore
loses its hooks loudly — the harness prints the spawn failure — instead of
running them on whatever python3 happens to be first on PATH and failing
silently at import.

WHY NOT A RE-EXEC INSIDE hooks/hook-meter-run.py. That was built and proven
first, but every hooks/*.py file is a sealed script entrypoint in the SCAC
source inventory, and editing one owes a forward-only registry successor: a
generated registry file, a production migration and a disposable-Postgres
catalog measurement. The config is a gate-integrity CONTRACT (hashed, blessed)
but not an inventoried entrypoint, so pinning the interpreter there costs a
bless and one `config-as-code.py install --apply` per machine, and no seal.

TWO DELIBERATE EXCEPTIONS, both held by other suites and honoured here:
  * The two drift-recording hooks (run-record-gate.py driving drift-claim-gate
    and drift-assertion-gate) bootstrap from the FIXED, absolute
    /usr/bin/python3 and then exec the venv themselves; ops/drive-runtime-
    hooks-selftest.py asserts that literal because PATH is attacker-influenced
    and that pair is what records drift. A fixed absolute path satisfies the
    property this file protects, so it is allowed for exactly that launcher.
  * ops/config/codex-hooks.json is frozen against a historical commit by
    ops/context-handoff-gate-selftest.py (Codex hook continuity) and Codex is
    launched from a terminal whose PATH carries Homebrew. It is left as it is
    and is NOT covered here; moving it is a separate decision.

WHAT IS CHECKED, deterministically and without running a hook:
  1. every command in hooks.json that launches a CARR hook or ops script
     starts with `{{REPO}}/.venv/bin/python`, after any leading VAR=value
     assignments, except the run-record-gate launcher above;
  2. no command in hooks.json still says `/usr/bin/env python3`;
  3. on this machine, if the venv interpreter exists it reports 3.10 or newer,
     so the pin points at something that can actually run the gates.
