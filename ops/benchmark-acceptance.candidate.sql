-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-A00: durable benchmark-manifest persistence and the
-- exact-hash human acceptance rail (requirement Q012, decisions Q008.D1,
-- Q128.D1, Q143.D1; gate benchmark-contract-accepted).
--
-- CANDIDATE SQL. This file is source, not a migration. It carries no migration
-- ledger preflight, is not listed in public.schema_migrations, creates no role,
-- and is not applied to Production by anything in this slice. Landing it as a
-- numbered migration is a separate, Joe-gated act.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. benchmark-minimum.v5.js can compute the one payload digest a
-- verified partner would have to accept, and can authenticate an acceptance
-- envelope that already exists. It cannot store a manifest and it cannot accept
-- one. This file is the missing durable half: the benchmark SUBJECT as typed
-- rows, an independent review bound to exact bytes, and a verified-partner
-- acceptance receipt whose acceptor is derived from the authenticated session.
--
-- IT IS NOT A SECOND PROJECTION LAYER. The payload digest is RECOMPUTED from
-- the persisted rows on every read, review and acceptance. A caller may supply
-- a hash; it is only ever compared against the one the rows produce. The
-- manifest is therefore stored as typed rows rather than as one jsonb blob whose
-- meaning nothing in the database can check. TEN relations carry the whole rail:
-- the draft, its six ordered content tables (dimensions, workloads, request-size
-- points, concurrency levels, browsers and evaluator seats), the independent
-- review, the measurement coverage attestation recorded beside a passing review,
-- and the acceptance receipt.
--
-- THREE THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT STORED, because storing them would move an
-- authority this slice does not hold:
--
--   1. The FIXED CONSTANTS. slo_thresholds, cost_variance_thresholds and
--      deadline_contract are identity, not configuration (r7 declares each
--      field `const`). They are EMITTED by the immutable functions below and
--      hashed into every preimage, so no caller-chosen threshold can ever
--      reach a digest. A manifest that disagrees with them is refused in
--      benchmark-minimum.v5.js before it reaches this file, and could not be
--      expressed here in any case.
--   2. The MEASUREMENT SET. r7's pass_rule requires every required matrix cell
--      to be exercised, and the required matrix is combinatorial (the kernel
--      caps it at 200000 cells). The samples are far too large to live here, so
--      a passing review NAMES the exact `sha256:` digest of the set its writer
--      read; the samples themselves stay outside this record layer.
--      READ THAT NARROWLY. The digest NAMES bytes. It does not prove anything
--      about them, and nothing in this database evaluates coverage. Who proved
--      what is a property of the caller, and there are two kinds:
--        * a review written through the MCP verb review-benchmark-manifest-draft
--          has had its coverage proved by the kernel's
--          evaluateBenchmarkWorkloadCoverage against the payload REBUILT FROM
--          THESE ROWS, and the digest was computed there rather than supplied;
--        * a review written by any other holder of the writer bundle calling
--          ops.benchmark_review_manifest_draft directly carries a digest this
--          database took on that writer's word.
--      Both are TRUSTED writers -- direct INSERT is granted to nobody and the
--      write functions reach only the writer and authority bundles -- and that
--      trusted-writer authority is deliberately preserved rather than replaced
--      by a second authority. The RECORD that tells the two apart is now written:
--      ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_attestation, recorded in the same
--      definer call that records the passing review, names the kernel evaluator,
--      the payload digest it proved against and the measurement digest it proved
--      over. Read that narrowly too -- see THE REMAINING TRUST BOUNDARY below.
--   3. A REVIEW TTL. r7 attaches no currentness window to benchmark-manifest.v1
--      at all -- no maximum review age, and no relation to the consumer-gate
--      receipt TTLs, which govern a different set of receipts. Inventing one
--      here would be a second currentness authority, so currentness is enforced
--      the one way r7 does settle: a review and an acceptance must each name the
--      digest the rows produce RIGHT NOW, and a passing review that no longer
--      names the live digest cannot be accepted.
--
-- NO ACTOR ARRIVES IN A PAYLOAD. Proposal and review derive the writer from
-- ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id(), the existing server-established writer
-- context (its name is historical; its contract is "the active actor the server
-- established for this transaction", and reusing it is what keeps one writer
-- derivation rather than two). Acceptance derives the partner from
-- ops.authority_actor_slug(), which reads session_user. Direct INSERT is
-- granted to nobody, so neither derivation can be stepped around with raw SQL.
-- No column named accepted_by_identity, verified_human or partner_confirmed
-- exists anywhere below: a boolean a caller can set is not a verification.
--
-- WHAT AN ACCEPTANCE MUST BIND, AND WHAT IS STILL UNBOUND HERE.
-- r7's receipt_producer_step_registry makes
-- step:benchmark-contract-human-exact-hash-acceptance-receipt depend on exactly
-- two steps: step:portfolio-constitution-human-exact-hash-acceptance-receipt
-- and step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome. Acceptance additionally rests on the
-- passing review's measurement evidence, which is where the third gap sits.
--
--   PORTFOLIO -- BOUND, TO EXACTLY WHAT IT PROVES AND NO MORE. The existing rail
--     from migration 0496 answers it. ops.portfolio_accepted_revision() returns
--     the current accepted revision, raises on an integrity failure, and returns
--     null when nothing is accepted. Acceptance binds that revision id and its
--     recomputed accepted digest, and refuses when there is no accepted
--     portfolio. No accepted portfolio is invented here and none is created by
--     this file.
--     STATED EXACTLY, because the previous wording overclaimed: portfolio_ref is
--     a reference the ACCEPTOR names. This binding proves that the named
--     portfolio constitution is accepted, is intact at this instant, and was
--     accepted strictly before this acceptance. It does NOT prove that this
--     benchmark manifest descends from that portfolio. Nothing in this database
--     records a benchmark-to-portfolio lineage edge, so none is asserted, and
--     none is invented: r7 makes the portfolio ACCEPTANCE STEP a prerequisite,
--     not a lineage relation, so adding a lineage rule here would be a policy
--     this slice does not hold. The claim is simply not made.
--   GATE ZERO -- BOUND AS OF MIGRATION 0502, AND THE OLD READING IS RETIRED BY
--     THE PACKET RATHER THAN BY PREFERENCE. This block used to say r7 registers
--     no v5 producer for step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome and that the outcome
--     is produced outside this system. The card-10 amendment (decision
--     311a9af5-3685-4c47-a158-f8dd70870ca1) added the producer row, and
--     tools/doctorcre-v5-review.cjs's own comment now says the external boundary
--     moved down to the four predecessors. Gate Zero is a v5 producer with the
--     role independent_control_plane_oracle, and the seat that holds it -- the
--     independent Codex reviewer lane -- records the outcome itself under Joe's
--     2026-09-13 ruling d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-9f1a-2b3c4d5e6f70, with no partner
--     countersign. ops.gate_zero_read_only_outcome holds those rows.
--     ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome() below is STILL a PRIVATE reader granted
--     to no role and reachable only from the definer functions here, and it
--     STILL raises when no current passing outcome exists -- so an acceptance
--     attempted before one is recorded refuses exactly as it always did. What
--     changed is that the refusal is now about the rows, not about the absence
--     of a place to put them. A caller-selected work-request reference, a
--     synthetic fixture digest and a Gate Zero policy invented in this file are
--     all still refused.
--   MEASUREMENT COVERAGE -- BOUND, TO EXACTLY WHAT IT PROVES AND NO MORE. A
--     review row carries the digest of the measurement set its writer read (see
--     2 above). Beside it, ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_attestation now
--     records WHAT PROVED IT: the kernel evaluator by name from a closed set,
--     the payload digest that evaluator returned, the measurement digest it
--     proved over, and the digest of the evaluation result so the judgement is
--     replayable. It is written in the SAME definer call that writes the review,
--     and a passing review cannot be written without it, so the pass and its
--     attestation cannot come apart.
--     ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_binding(uuid) reads that record and is
--     still PRIVATE, still fail-closed, and still deliberately INDEPENDENT of
--     Gate Zero. It RECOMPUTES the payload digest from the draft's own rows with
--     ops.benchmark_payload_digest() and refuses an attestation naming a
--     different one, refuses an attestation whose measurement digest is not the
--     review row's, and refuses an evaluator name outside the closed set. Two of
--     the three attested values are therefore checkable here rather than merely
--     stored.
--
-- THE REMAINING TRUST BOUNDARY, STATED EXACTLY, because the attestation moves it
-- less far than it may look. The samples live outside this record layer and this
-- database cannot read them. The attestation records that the MCP path ran
-- evaluateBenchmarkWorkloadCoverage over the payload rebuilt from these rows and
-- over bytes that hash to that digest -- and the database is still believing a
-- TRUSTED WRITER about an evaluation it did not perform and cannot repeat. What
-- the attestation buys is that the assertion is explicit, attributed and
-- auditable instead of implicit and anonymous, and that an unattested pass is
-- unwritable. This database does not become an independent verifier of benchmark
-- coverage, and nothing below should be read as saying that it does.
--
-- AND ACCEPTANCE STILL REFUSES UNTIL BOTH ANSWER. The attestation cleared one
-- binding on its own evidence; migration 0502 cleared the other by landing the
-- Gate Zero outcome record and implementing its reader.
-- ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome() is still read FIRST and still raises when no
-- current passing outcome exists, so no acceptance receipt can exist until an
-- independent oracle seat has recorded one.
--
-- Acceptance is strictly after both r7 prerequisites and the review it rests on:
-- an acceptance recorded AT the Gate Zero instant, at the portfolio acceptance
-- instant, or at the review instant is refused exactly as one recorded before it
-- is. That exclusive reading is the same one benchmark-minimum.v5.js applies to
-- member observation, so the two paths cannot differ on the boundary.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Shared derivations, reused rather than restated.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- CANONICALIZATION IS NOT REDECIDED HERE. ops.portfolio_canonical_json() from
-- migration 0496 already matches artifact-trust.js's canonicalJson exactly,
-- including JavaScript number rendering, and every function below calls it. A
-- benchmark-local copy would be a second canonicalization authority, and two
-- canonicalizers that agree today are two that can disagree after one edit.
--
-- One property that copy DOES have to hold, stated so a reviewer can check it:
-- artifact-trust.js sorts object keys by UTF-16 code unit and
-- ops.portfolio_canonical_json sorts by `collate "C"` (UTF-8 byte order). Those
-- two orders coincide for every key in benchmark-manifest.v1, all of which are
-- ASCII lower-case and underscore. A future non-ASCII key would have to
-- reconcile them; there is none, and adding one is a deliberate edit.
--
-- THE SAME DIVERGENCE HAS A SECOND FACE, IN VALUES RATHER THAN KEYS, and it is
-- the one that can actually admit a row the kernel would refuse. The kernel
-- bounds free text with JavaScript's String#length, which counts UTF-16 CODE
-- UNITS; SQL's char_length counts CODEPOINTS. They differ by exactly one per
-- codepoint above U+FFFF, which JavaScript stores as a surrogate pair -- so a
-- 300-codepoint emoji outlier_rule is 600 units to the kernel, which refuses it,
-- and 300 characters to char_length, which would not. Wherever a bound exists on
-- both sides the guards below apply the UTF-16 count through
-- ops.benchmark_utf16_length(), so nothing can be stored here that fails kernel
-- validation on the way back out. Where r7 declares no maximum at all -- workload
-- ids, browser triples, dimension values -- neither side invents one, so the two
-- cannot disagree there.

-- r7 canonicalization_contract, receipt_payload_digest_rule: the domain tag for

-- PREREQUISITE TWO, NOW BOUND. THE PRIVATE GATE ZERO READER.
--
-- THIS BLOCK WAS A STUB FROM V5-A00 UNTIL migration 0502. What it said then was
-- true then: no table in this database held an authenticated Gate Zero outcome,
-- so an acceptance had nothing here to bind to. Migration
-- 0502_gate_zero_read_only_outcome.sql lands that table, and this reader is
-- implemented against it in the same change -- which the stub's own integration
-- requirement demanded, because either half alone opens the gate without a
-- record on the other side. The module-side twin, readGateZeroOutcome in
-- mcp-server/src/benchmark-acceptance-store.v5.js, landed with it.
--
-- ONE CLAUSE OF THE OLD BLOCK WAS ALSO WRONG BY THE TIME IT WAS DELETED, and it
-- is worth naming rather than quietly dropping. It said r7 registers no v5
-- producer for step:gate-zero-read-only-outcome and that this is intentional.
-- The card-10 amendment (decision 311a9af5-3685-4c47-a158-f8dd70870ca1, applied
-- under Joe's ruling on open loop #589) added the producer row, and
-- tools/doctorcre-v5-review.cjs's own comment now says the external boundary
-- moved down to the four predecessors. Gate Zero is a v5 producer with a
-- registered role, oracle, output schema, evidence scope and gate.
--
-- WHO PRODUCES ONE. The independent oracle seat -- the Codex reviewer lane,
-- staffed under charter ruling 8a1dad08-8707-4bb0-a159-c2831a00cea2 and Joe's
-- blanket approval 5e2b8c1a-9f47-4d63-b0e5-7a3d1c9f2e84 -- writing through
-- ops.gate_zero_record_read_only_outcome under Joe's 2026-09-13 ruling
-- d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-9f1a-2b3c4d5e6f70. No partner countersign. The human act
-- in this chain stays where the provisional ruling put it: downstream, on the
-- benchmark manifest acceptance, which is unchanged by all of this.
--
-- WHAT THIS FUNCTION STILL REFUSES TO DO. It does not accept an outcome digest
-- from the caller, read one out of configuration, derive one from a synthetic
-- fixture, select a work-request reference, or treat a recorded non-passing run
-- as a binding. Each of those would manufacture the exact authority the record
-- is supposed to carry. It reads one row and returns three fields.
--
-- WHICH ROW IS CURRENT, as an ordered procedure rather than a description:
-- status must be 'pass'; the expiry must not have passed; of what remains the
-- latest observed_at wins, tie-broken on outcome_digest descending so the order
-- is total; and none left raises, which is the same fail-closed posture the stub
-- had. The two refusals are distinguished -- nothing ever recorded, versus
-- everything recorded being expired or non-passing -- because those are
-- different problems for whoever hits them.
--
-- IT IS DEFINED IN TWO PLACES ON PURPOSE, AND THEY MUST NOT DRIFT. Migration
-- 0502 carries the definition that binds in a database; this file is candidate
-- source and is still not in public.schema_migrations. The bodies are
-- deliberately identical, and mcp-server/test/benchmark-acceptance-store.v5.test.mjs
-- asserts so by reading both files.
--
-- PRIVATE means private: this function is granted to no role below. It is
-- reachable only from the security-definer write path in this file, which runs
-- as the owner. It is not a public claim about Gate Zero and it is not a
-- configuration surface.

-- THE THIRD BINDING, NOW BOUND, AND DELIBERATELY STILL INDEPENDENT OF THE
-- SECOND. THE PRIVATE MEASUREMENT COVERAGE PROOF READER.
--
-- WHAT IT READS. ops.benchmark_manifest_review.measurement_set_digest names the
-- bytes a reviewer read. ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_attestation, written
-- in the same definer call, says HOW that digest came to be there: which
-- evaluator proved coverage, which payload digest it proved against, which
-- measurement digest it proved over. This function reads that attestation and
-- returns the three fields acceptance binds.
--
-- IT DOES NOT TRUST WHAT IT READS. Two of the three attested values are checked
-- against something the database derives for itself:
--   * the payload digest is RECOMPUTED with ops.benchmark_payload_digest() from
--     the draft's own rows. An attestation naming a payload digest the draft no
--     longer produces is refused, so appending content to a draft after a review
--     invalidates the attestation instead of silently outliving it;
--   * the measurement digest is compared against the review row's own. An
--     attestation that does not attest THIS review's bytes is refused;
--   * the evaluator name is constrained to ops.benchmark_coverage_evaluators().
-- A missing attestation refuses, exactly as it did when none could exist.
--
-- THIS IS NOT A SECOND COVERAGE AUTHORITY. It evaluates no matrix, reads no
-- samples and re-decides no r7 pass_rule; benchmark-minimum.v5.js remains the
-- only place coverage is judged. It answers "is there a checkable record binding
-- this review's digest to that judgement", and no more than that.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL TRUE AFTER THIS LANDS, said here rather than left to be
-- discovered: the samples are outside this record layer, the evaluation cannot
-- be repeated here, and the database is believing a trusted writer about work it
-- did not do. The attestation makes that belief explicit, attributed and
-- auditable, and makes an unattested pass unwritable. It does not make this
-- database a verifier of coverage.
--
-- IT IS SEPARATE FROM GATE ZERO ON PURPOSE, in both directions, and it stayed
-- separate when Gate Zero landed. This binding resolving did not resolve Gate
-- Zero, and Gate Zero landing in migration 0502 does not upgrade this one:
-- ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome() is still read first and still raises when
-- there is no current passing outcome, and this reader still refuses on its own
-- grounds afterwards. That is the fourth thing the coverage requirement
-- explicitly refuses -- silently upgrading the assertion when Gate Zero lands.

  'The only way to record an independent benchmark review, and the only way to record the coverage attestation that must accompany a passing one. The reviewer and the attesting writer are both derived from the server-established writer context and neither is a parameter. A pass with no attestation is refused and a non-pass with one is refused, so the pass and its attestation cannot come apart. The attestation is still a TRUSTED WRITER''s statement -- through the MCP verb its values are benchmark-minimum.v5.js''s own return value, through a direct call they are the writer''s assertion -- but it is now explicit, attributed, closed to a known evaluator set, and checked against the digest this draft actually produces. Every stored parameter, review_summary and the attestation included, is compared on an idempotent replay.';

-- ACCEPTANCE. Every authoritative fact is DERIVED inside this function: the

-- rail, and the Gate Zero outcome from the private reader. The caller supplies
-- only the draft, the key, the hash it believes is current, the review it rests
-- on, and which portfolio it descends from. There is no parameter through which
-- an accepted_by, a verified boolean or a Gate Zero digest could arrive.
--
-- THIS FUNCTION CANNOT SUCCEED TODAY, FOR ONE REMAINING REASON:
-- ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome() raises, and it is called before any row is
-- written. ops.benchmark_measurement_coverage_binding() NO LONGER RAISES. It
-- reads the attestation recorded beside the review and RETURNS for an attested
-- review, refusing only a review whose record does not hold up: no attestation,
-- an attested payload digest the draft no longer produces, an evaluator outside
-- the closed set, or a measurement digest the review does not name. What it
-- returns is still a trusted writer's attributed assertion and not an
-- independent verification -- the samples stay outside this record layer and
-- this database evaluates no coverage itself.
