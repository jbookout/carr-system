"""ops/staging-jobs-dsn-selftest.py — the acceptance test for
tools/staging_jobs_dsn.py, and the regression guard for the credential-blinding
defect that file was written in response to.

NO DATABASE, NO NETWORK, ONE TIER. Everything here is a pure-function check or a
refusal proven before any connection is attempted; the staging endpoint resolver
is substituted so the suite never calls neonctl. That is deliberate: this runs in
ops/ci.sh's selftest loop on every push, and a gate that needs a provider is a
gate that goes yellow on a plane.

WHAT IT IS GUARDING, measured 2026-08-18. PR #288 (cd3d7386) moved
`tools/ops-record.py run` to connect("routine"), which reads CARR_DB_JOBS_URL and
ignores DATABASE_URL. Two suites had encoded the OLD credential order into their
"unreachable database" helpers — set DATABASE_URL to a dead port, delete
CARR_DB_JOBS_URL — so ops-record.py's _load_db_env() re-supplied the PRODUCTION
jobs DSN by setdefault and they went on testing against production. Tier 1 of
ops/scheduled-run-record-selftest.py wrote 46 fabricated SUCCEEDED rows into
production's ops.run over two days, and tier 2 of both suites recorded at
production's registry instead of staging's and failed every read-back.

The last block below is the check that would have caught it on day one: every
credential name the recorder declares must be blinded by both suites, and
blinded to somewhere unreachable. It reads ops-record.py's own list rather than
a copy, so a fourth mode added to DSN_FOR fails here until both suites blind it.
