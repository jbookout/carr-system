-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-J102: durable persistence for the healthcare CRE
-- lifecycle -- Prospect through Client/Engagement/Assignment/Deal (requirements
-- Q069, Q072, Q077-Q083, Q094-Q096, Q103; gate journey-one-production-accepted).
--
-- CANDIDATE SQL. This file is source, not a migration. It carries no migration
-- ordinal, is not listed in public.schema_migrations, creates no role and no
-- user, and is not applied to Production by anything in this slice. Landing it
-- as a numbered migration is a separate, Joe-gated act.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS. cre-lifecycle.v5.js can judge a transition against loaded state
-- and loaded evidence, and cre-lifecycle-store.v5.js can build the exact
-- envelopes for it. Neither can store anything. This file is the missing durable
-- half: authoritative current state per subject, append-only events beside it,
-- the first-party business records evidence is read from, the external
-- Salesforce references, the correction receipts, and the one writer that
-- applies a whole coupled transition or none of it.
--
-- IT IS NOT A SECOND DECISION LAYER. The transition table, the refusal matrix
-- and the coupled-fact sets live in the kernel and are not restated here. What
-- this file enforces is the half a kernel cannot: that the state a decision was
-- taken against has not moved, that the EXACT evidence is still what it was when
-- read, that the whole coupled set lands together, and that nobody writes any of
-- it except through a registered writer that derives its own actor.
--
-- THE ONE THING IT DOES TRANSCRIBE, and why. ops.j102_admission_policy() below
-- carries the kernel's OWN exported transition and evidence contracts -- which
-- actor class may perform each transition, which operation performs it, which
-- subjects and fields it may write, which evidence kinds bound to which subject
-- it requires. Not because a second opinion is wanted, but because
-- ops.j102_apply_transition is granted to carr_writer as well as carr_authority,
-- and a JavaScript assertion is not a control on a caller holding that grant. The
-- transcription is asserted EQUAL to the kernel's exports, contract by contract,
-- by the Node parity suite; two copies with a comparison between them are one
-- contract with two readers, and two without one are a future contradiction. This
-- file invents no state value, no actor class, no evidence kind and no business
-- rule of its own, and the parity test is what keeps that true.
--
-- WHAT IT TRANSCRIBES BEYOND THE DECLARATION TABLE, and why that was not
-- optional. The admission map also carries, per transition, the EXACT resulting
-- value of every field the kernel's evaluator writes, the exact set of subjects
-- it writes them on, and the exact set of events it appends. Declaring only
-- WHICH FIELDS a transition may move is not a control on the result: a routine
-- `open-assignment` call may move `assignment_phase`, and `committed` is a
-- commitment performed with none of a commitment's evidence. The same gap
-- admitted an arbitrary `open_negotiation_count`, a `pending_deal_id` pointing at
-- a deal that was never created, a cleared reference kept, a deleted key, a
-- coupled write sent as a subset, and an event of any kind on a correctly bound
-- subject. Every one of those is now compared against the committed row, the
-- other subjects in the same call and the evidence re-read under the lock.
--
-- AND ops.j102_apply_transition STILL CREATES NO PRIMARY SUBJECT. A transition
-- advances a subject that ALREADY EXISTS. An earlier revision of this file
-- admitted a proposed primary subject with a null compare-and-swap operand and
-- called it a bootstrap: it was not one, because a created primary has no
-- committed row for the transition's own prerequisites, instrument kind and
-- prior-state conditions to be checked against, and a direct caller could
-- therefore seed a deal that was born executed or an assignment that was born
-- committed. That path is refused by name and is NOT reopened below. Inside the
-- transition writer, creation remains admitted only for the two COUPLED subjects
-- the kernel itself creates -- the engagement of establish-client-and-engagement
-- and the pending deal of commit-winning-property -- in their exact declared
-- shape, and both require a primary that is already committed.
--
-- THE FIRST ROW OF A CHAIN NOW HAS ITS OWN DOOR, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT FUNCTION
-- WITH A DIFFERENT MAP. ops.j102_initialize_subject below creates exactly one
-- subject of exactly one of three kinds -- a prospect relationship, an assignment
-- under an already ACTIVE engagement held by a CLIENT, a property negotiation
-- under a still-open assignment -- each in the EARLIEST DECLARED STATE of its
-- kind and in a shape the admission map fixes field by field. It performs no
-- transition, checks no transition prerequisite and skips none: every one of them
-- remains mandatory for the transition that follows, which is why the two writers
-- are separate rather than one writer with a flag.
--
-- WHY THAT DOOR CARRIES NO EVIDENCE, since it is the one place a reader should
-- expect some. Every evidence kind in this rail binds to a SUBJECT, a first-party
-- record carries that binding in its own typed columns, and the record writer
-- takes the binding at write time -- so an assignment mandate about assignment A
-- cannot exist before assignment A does, and cannot be the evidence for creating
-- it. What the initialization writer checks instead is the PARENT CHAIN, re-read
-- and compare-and-swapped under its own locks, plus a created shape that carries
-- no lifecycle claim: a prospect is not a client, a created assignment is not an
-- opened one, and an LOI draft is neither a submission nor a Deal.
--
-- WHICH DATABASE IT MAY BE APPLIED TO. A FRESH one, or one whose J102 relations
-- already carry EXACTLY the shape below. Every DDL here is idempotent, which is
-- the right idiom for re-applying the same shape and the wrong one for a database
-- holding an EARLIER candidate's shape -- the create would be a silent no-op and
-- the first write would fail deep inside a writer on a missing column. The
-- preflight block below therefore REFUSES to apply the file in that case, naming
-- the relation and the columns. It is not a migration: it alters nothing,
-- backfills nothing, renumbers nothing and drops no relation that holds data.
--
-- NOTHING IS RE-DERIVED THAT ALREADY HAS A HOME. The tenant, the canonical JSON,
-- the digest, the instant parser, the server clock and the authenticated
-- principal all come from ops.f01_* in domain.sql, and this file CALLS them
-- rather than restating them. Two canonicalizers that agree today are two that
-- can disagree after one edit, and a second principal derivation would be a
-- second answer to "who is writing". The prerequisite block below refuses to
-- apply this file at all against a database that does not carry them.
--
-- THE ONE APPROVAL READER IS PRIVATE AND ALWAYS RAISES, deliberately, on the
-- same terms as ops.benchmark_gate_zero_outcome(): see
-- ops.j102_typed_approval() below. Q077's "approved representation equivalent"
-- and Q095's "explicit approved exception" both rest on a typed authenticated
-- approval, and nothing in this record layer PRODUCES one. Refusing is the
-- honest state; the alternative would be inventing the business policy the
-- approval is supposed to carry.
--
-- FIVE THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT DONE HERE, because each would move an
-- authority this slice does not hold:
--
--   1. NO SALESFORCE MAPPING. ops.j102_salesforce_reference stores the
--      opportunity's own name and phase and a link to a DoctorCRE subject. There
--      is no column, function or view anywhere below that turns a Salesforce
--      phase into a lifecycle state, and ops.j102_read exposes none.
--   2. NO LEGACY REWRITE. The compatibility view PROJECTS the new records into
--      the old shape for reading. It is not updatable, nothing writes back
--      through it, and no legacy table is renamed, dropped or altered.
--   3. NO CALLER RETIREMENT. ops.j102_migration_readiness() reports that the old
--      interface may not be retired, for every input, because no verified caller
--      census exists. It is a reader, and it says no.
--   4. NO TOUR. Journey 3 owns active Tour behaviour. No relation, function or
--      view here creates, activates or reads one.
--   5. NO F01 SCHEMA PATCH. Evidence has to name the subject it advances, and an
--      F01 document carries no lifecycle binding. Rather than adding a column to
--      a schema this slice does not own, the association lives in the J102-scoped
--      ops.j102_evidence_subject_link below, written by its own registered
--      partner-only producer. Nothing here alters, extends or writes to any
--      ops.f01_* relation; F01 remains the sole authority for document identity
--      and document state, and an association asserts neither.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HIGH-2 -- THE SHAPE PREFLIGHT, and what it deliberately is NOT.
--
-- Every DDL below is `create ... if not exists`, which is the right idiom for a
-- file that may be applied twice to the SAME shape and the wrong one for a file
-- whose relations have CHANGED shape since an earlier candidate. Applied to a
-- database where a PREVIOUS candidate already created ops.j102_first_party_record
-- with three fewer columns, the create is a silent no-op, the old shape survives,
-- and the first record-lifecycle-fact write fails deep inside a writer with
-- `column "bound_subject_kind" does not exist`. That is a confusing failure in
-- the wrong place, and it is the most likely way running the SQL fixture against
-- a previously seeded database goes wrong.
--
-- SO THE FILE REFUSES TO APPLY instead, naming the relation and the missing
-- columns. IT IS NOT A MIGRATION: it carries no ordinal, it ALTERs nothing, it
-- backfills nothing, it assigns no version to any existing row, and it drops
-- nothing that holds data. The only remedy it names is the honest one -- a fresh
-- database, or a database whose J102 relations already carry exactly this shape.
--
-- THIS CANDIDATE HAS NEVER BEEN EXECUTED, so no deployed old shape exists from
-- this slice. The preflight exists for the case where somebody applied an EARLIER
-- draft of this same candidate to a scratch database and then applies this one.

-- Guards.
--
-- WHY A CALL-STACK CHECK RATHER THAN A FLAG, restated because it is the same
-- reasoning F01 records and the same trap: a transaction-local flag is something
-- a caller with DML rights could set for itself, so it would prove nothing.
-- PG_CONTEXT names the actual PL/pgSQL frames beneath the trigger, so the guard
-- can require that a write genuinely arrived through a registered ops.j102_*
-- writer.
--
-- THE SCHEMA HALF, and how far it can honestly be taken. PG_CONTEXT renders each
-- frame through format_procedure, which OMITS the schema when the function is
-- visible on the current search_path -- and this guard's own search_path puts
-- `ops` ahead of `public`, so a genuine ops.j102_apply_transition frame prints
-- unqualified. Requiring a literal `ops.` prefix would therefore refuse every
-- legitimate write, which is why the prefix stays optional. What makes the
-- optional prefix safe is that an unqualified `j102_apply_transition(` frame can
-- only be the function that search_path resolves that name to, and the
-- application-time check below asserts that every writer name resolves to the
-- ops one under exactly this search_path. A same-named function in `public` is
-- shadowed by ops and prints QUALIFIED, so `public.j102_apply_transition(` does
-- not satisfy the pattern.

-- The first-party business records evidence is read from: a mandate, a winning
-- property commitment, a diligence outcome, a closing settlement and its actual
-- date, an invoice, a payment, a completion, a deal failure and its reason, a
-- correction.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT A CALLER BOOLEAN WITH EXTRA STEPS. A row here is written by an
-- authenticated actor through a registered writer, carries the server's own
-- instant, is append-only, and is addressable afterwards. A transition names one
-- by id and the record layer loads it; the fact never travels inside the
-- transition request. That is the difference between "the broker recorded that
-- the closing happened on the 14th" and "the caller said closed: true".
-- THE TYPED SUBJECT BINDING IS PART OF THE ROW, and it is the correction this
-- table most needed. A record used to say WHAT happened and WHO recorded it and
-- never WHICH deal, assignment or client it happened to, so one closing
-- settlement with one date could close any number of unrelated deals and a
-- commitment recorded for assignment A could commit assignment B. The columns
-- below are CHECK-bound to the hashed envelope, so the binding cannot be edited
-- beside the bytes it is supposed to describe.

-- THE EVIDENCE -> SUBJECT ASSOCIATION, and why it lives here rather than in F01.
--
-- A first-party record can carry its own binding because this rail writes it. An
-- F01 DOCUMENT cannot: F01 owns document identity, versions, signature, validity
-- and version state, and it holds no lifecycle concept at all -- there is no
-- column on an F01 document that says which DoctorCRE deal it belongs to, and
-- adding one would be this slice editing a schema it does not own to make its
-- own problem easier. The same is true of a corporate artifact.
--
-- So the association is held HERE, scoped to J102, and it is a RECORD rather
-- than a claim on a request: one partner-authored, append-only, digest-bound row
-- saying that one exact document version, or one exact artifact, belongs to one
-- lifecycle subject. A transition reads it; nobody asserts it in passing.
--
-- IT IS PINNED, NOT NAMED. The association binds document_id + version_no +
-- content_digest, so a document that gains a version is not the document that
-- was associated and needs its own association. That is deliberately the same
-- rule the evidence pin itself follows, for the same reason: "the document still
-- exists" is not the question.
--
-- WHAT AN ASSOCIATION IS NOT. It is not a document, it does not create one, and
-- it asserts nothing whatever about signature, validity or version state -- every
-- one of those is read from F01 at judgement time and none of them is copied
-- here. A partner saying "this lease is that deal's lease" is not a partner
-- saying the lease is signed.

-- THE PRIVATE FAIL-CLOSED APPROVAL READER.
--
-- This is the whole of the typed-approval binding, and it is a stub on purpose.
--
-- WHAT IS MISSING, PRECISELY. Any AUTHENTICATED RECORD IN THIS DATABASE of an
-- approval that a named class of agreement is a representation equivalent
-- (Q077), or that a named assignment may hold a second selected property or
-- lease-draft target (Q095). No table holds one because no workflow writes one,
-- so there is nothing here for a transition to bind to.
--
-- WHAT THIS FUNCTION REFUSES TO DO INSTEAD, because each would manufacture the
-- authority the absent record is supposed to carry: accept an approval from its
-- caller, read one out of configuration, derive one from a synthetic fixture,
-- treat an approval REFERENCE stored on an assignment row as the approval
-- itself, or treat "the reader is not built" as "the approval is not required".
--
-- IT IS GRANTED TO NOBODY. Exposing it would turn "this record layer cannot
-- authenticate a lifecycle approval" into a callable claim about approvals in
-- general, and a callable stub is the first step toward a configurable one. The
-- writers below reach it as the function owner, which is the only access it
-- needs. In practice no shipped path reaches it: the store's own
-- V5_J102_ABSENT_EVIDENCE_READERS registry turns those two evidence kinds into a
-- recordable policy refusal before it ever issues a read, so a caller learns
-- which fact is missing instead of receiving a database error. This function is
-- the same refusal one layer down, for any future writer that reaches for an
-- approval without going through that registry.

-- BLOCK-1 / BLOCK-2 -- THE CLOSED SQL ADMISSION MAP.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is NOT a second decision layer and it
-- decides nothing the kernel decides: there is no business rule here, no new
-- state value, no new actor class, no new evidence kind and no policy that is not
-- already written in cre-lifecycle.v5.js. It is a TRANSCRIPTION of the kernel's
-- own exported contracts into the one place a caller holding the writer's EXECUTE
-- grant cannot go around -- and the Node suite asserts, contract by contract,
-- that the transcription is exact against `v5J102TransitionContract` and
-- `v5J102EvidenceContract`. Two copies that nothing compares are a future
-- contradiction; two copies with a parity check are one contract with two
-- readers, which is the only shape that closes a direct-writer gap at all.
--
-- WHY IT HAD TO EXIST. `ops.j102_apply_transition` is granted to carr_writer as
-- well as carr_authority, and carr_writer resolves to `sponsored_agent`. Before
-- this map the writer asked WHO the actor was and never WHAT CLASS it held, never
-- validated `p_transition_id` against any vocabulary at all, and never compared
-- the transition to the operation the diagnostics named. A sponsored agent on a
-- direct call could therefore perform `record-deal-closing`, `cancel-pending-deal`
-- or `commit-winning-property` -- the three the kernel and the store both hold to
-- a verified partner -- and could name any transition beside any operation. The
-- record layer already accepts exactly this restatement one table over
-- (j102_record_first_party_fact restates the four partner-AUTHORED record kinds,
-- and the relation restates them a third time as a CHECK) precisely so that H5 is
-- not a JavaScript assertion. This is the same move for the transition table.
--
-- THE FIVE THINGS IT LETS THE WRITER ASK, none of which it could ask before:
--   1. is `p_transition_id` a transition at all
--   2. may the operation the diagnostics name perform THAT transition
--   3. may this actor's DERIVED class perform it
--   4. which subject does it advance, which others may it write, and which FIELDS
--      of each may it move -- so an allowed operation is not an arbitrary rewrite
--   5. which evidence kinds does it require, from which source, bound to WHICH
--      subject and authored by which class
--
-- `writes` IS DERIVED, NOT INVENTED. For every transition the keys of `writes`
-- are exactly {subject_kind} union {the prefixes of coupled_facts}, and the
-- fields under each key are exactly the coupled facts for that kind plus the
-- three DERIVED COUNTERS AND MIRRORS the kernel also moves and does not list as
-- coupled facts: relationship.active_engagement_count,
-- assignment.open_negotiation_count and assignment.active_lease_draft_target_id.
-- Those three are named in `derived_fields` below so the parity test can subtract
-- them and prove the remainder is the coupled-fact set exactly.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHAT THE SECOND CORRECTION ADDS, AND WHY `writes` WAS NOT ENOUGH.
--
-- `writes` answers "may this transition move that field". It does not answer
-- "to WHAT". A routine `open-assignment` call could therefore supply
-- `assignment_phase: "committed"`, or delete the key outright; `record-payment`
-- could write any payment_state it liked; `cancel-pending-deal` could clear the
-- deal reference and leave the counter at an arbitrary number. Field MOVABILITY
-- is not target validation, and every one of those is a permitted field with a
-- forbidden value.
--
-- So each transition now carries `subjects` and `events`, transcribed from the
-- kernel's own evaluator (applyTransition and axisResult in cre-lifecycle.v5.js)
-- rather than from its declaration table:
--
--   subjects[kind].role     primary or coupled -- and the FULL set is REQUIRED.
--                           A call that proposes the deal and omits the
--                           assignment `cancel-pending-deal` also returns is a
--                           subset of a coupled write, which Q082 refuses.
--   subjects[kind].mode     update, or create for the TWO subjects the kernel
--                           actually creates: the engagement of
--                           establish-client-and-engagement and the deal of
--                           commit-winning-property. Everything else must
--                           already exist. THE PRIMARY SUBJECT IS NEVER
--                           CREATABLE -- see the writer's own note.
--   .prior_conditions       the evaluator's per-subject refusals, checked
--                           against the COMMITTED row: an assignment holding a
--                           pending deal, a negotiation that is not the winner,
--                           a closing against unresolved diligence.
--   .effects                the EXACT resulting value of every field the
--                           transition moves, as an expression over the stored
--                           prior state, the other subjects in the same call and
--                           the evidence that was re-read under the lock. Every
--                           other field must be byte-identical to the committed
--                           row.
--   .creation_shape         for a created subject: the exact key set and the
--                           exact value of each key, so a creation cannot carry
--                           an extra field, omit one, or point at another
--                           assignment.
--   required_context        subjects the kernel requires to be LOADED and true
--                           without writing them -- the active engagement and
--                           the client relationship an assignment opens under.
--   events                  the exact event set: which kinds, on which subjects,
--                           AND the exact nested detail each one carries. Not
--                           "at least one event": a call cannot erase the history
--                           by sending an empty array, cannot append an event the
--                           transition does not produce, and cannot omit one it
--                           does. EVERY kind here is a literal read off a
--                           lifecycleEvent() call site; none is derived. The
--                           kernel's `payment_${level}` is a REASON_ID and has
--                           never been an event kind -- record-payment appends
--                           the constant `payment_recorded` -- and this map
--                           carries no derived-kind rule of any sort.
--   events[].detail         the EXACT value of every non-identity key the
--                           kernel's own lifecycleEvent() detail carries: the
--                           closing date on deal_closed, the cancellation reason
--                           on pending_deal_cancelled, the axis value on every
--                           axis event, the property and assignment a negotiation
--                           event names, and the evidence reference each event
--                           rested on. Written in the SAME effect vocabulary as
--                           the state targets, so a lying nested fact is refused
--                           by the machinery a lying state field already was.
--                           Three coupled events carry no evidence_reference at
--                           all, which is the kernel's shape and is transcribed
--                           rather than filled in.
--
-- NONE OF THIS IS A SECOND BUSINESS POLICY. Every value below is read off the
-- kernel's evaluator, and the Node suite proves it by running that evaluator on
-- real transitions and asserting the map PREDICTS its proposed_state and its
-- events exactly -- so a divergence is a test failure rather than a silent
-- second opinion.

comment on function ops.j102_admission_policy() is
  'The closed SQL admission map: which operation may perform which transition, which actor class may perform it, which subjects it must write and which it may CREATE (never the primary one), the EXACT resulting value of every field it moves, the exact event set it appends AND the exact nested detail of every one of those events, and which evidence kinds bound to which subject it requires. It also carries Q103''s reconciliation vocabulary -- the four conflict kinds evaluateConcurrentEdit can file and the field-class registry that says what class each field is -- because ops.j102_record_reconciliation_item is granted to carr_writer and enforces both against this map rather than against a caller''s label. A transcription of the kernel''s exported contracts and of its evaluator, asserted equal to both by the Node parity suite -- which runs the evaluator and requires this map to predict its answer. It decides nothing the kernel does not already decide and adds no business policy.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE EFFECT INTERPRETER.
--
-- One pure function, so "what should this field be" is answered in ONE place and
-- the writer below is a comparison rather than a second policy. It reads nothing:
-- every input it needs -- the committed prior states, the proposed states, the
-- subject ids of this call and the facts the evidence recheck read off stored
-- rows -- is passed in, which is also what makes it checkable by inspection.
--
-- IT ANSWERS IN ONE OF FOUR SHAPES.
--   {"kind":"exact","value":X}     the field must be exactly X.
--   {"kind":"any_of","values":[…]} the caller chooses, from the set the KERNEL
--                                  offers on that path and no wider: the mandate
--                                  scope, the diligence result, the return phase,
--                                  the payment level, the instrument kind.
--   {"kind":"declared_identifier","field":F}
--                                  the value is an IDENTIFIER the caller declares
--                                  and nothing can derive -- the property a new
--                                  negotiation concerns. Only the INITIALIZATION
--                                  writer accepts this kind, and it holds the
--                                  value to the identifier shape; the transition
--                                  writer refuses it, because a transition target
--                                  is always derivable from state or evidence.
--   {"kind":"unbound","why":…}     the value belongs to a layer this rail does
--                                  not re-derive. There is exactly ONE of these
--                                  in the whole map and it sits on an unreachable
--                                  branch; it is named rather than hidden.
--
-- AN EMPTY any_of IS A REFUSAL, not a wildcard: it is what a guard that removed
-- every candidate means, and the writer treats it as "no value is admissible
-- here".

comment on function ops.j102_expected_value(jsonb,jsonb,jsonb,jsonb,jsonb,jsonb) is
  'Compute the EXACT value the admission map says a field must hold after one transition, from the committed prior state, the other subjects in the same call, the ids this call proposes and the evidence facts the recheck read under the lock. Pure: it reads no relation and derives nothing from the caller. An empty any_of means no value is admissible on that path.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE EVIDENCE RECHECK.
--
-- This is the half a kernel cannot enforce, and it is the reason this file
-- exists rather than a set of plain INSERTs.
--
-- The store read the evidence, the kernel judged it, and time passed. A document
-- can gain a version, an artifact can be superseded, a first-party record can be
-- rewritten -- all between the read and the write. Applying a decision taken
-- against evidence that has since moved is the same defect as last-writer-wins,
-- one layer down, so the EXACT pin is re-read HERE, inside the transaction that
-- already holds the subject locks, and any movement refuses the whole transition.
--
-- IT COMPARES PINS, NOT SHAPES. A document reference names the version and the
-- content digest it meant; a first-party record names the record digest it meant.
-- "The document still exists" is not the check. "The document is still the one
-- the decision was taken against" is.
--
-- AND IT RE-ASSERTS THE SUBJECT BINDING AGAINST THE SUBJECT THE TRANSITION IS
-- ACTUALLY ADVANCING, which is the half that was still missing after the first
-- correction. The recheck could compare the manifest's binding against the
-- EVIDENCE -- it re-read the record's own typed columns and asked the association
-- reader a yes/no question -- but the manifest's binding was itself caller-
-- supplied and was never compared to the subject envelopes, which arrive in a
-- different parameter. So a direct caller could present a genuine, unmoved,
-- correctly pinned closing settlement bound to deal B, propose a state change for
-- deal A, and satisfy every check: the record really was bound to deal B and the
-- manifest really said deal B. Deal A closed on deal B's settlement date.
--
-- MEMBERSHIP OF THE LOCK SET IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER, and that is worth saying
-- because it is the obvious fix and it does not hold: an attacker who has to make
-- the binding a MEMBER of the compare-and-swap key set simply adds deal B to the
-- key set with its true digest and goes on proposing deal A. What closes it is
-- identity, not membership: the caller passes the ONE PRIMARY SUBJECT the
-- validated transition advances -- derived from the transition contract's own
-- subject_kind and read off the proposed envelopes -- and every pin must bind to
-- exactly that subject, with the source, record kind and author class the
-- kernel's evidence contract names.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The single-argument form is replaced, not shadowed: leaving it in place would
-- leave a callable recheck that establishes "the evidence was still exact"
-- without ever being told which subject it was exact FOR. It holds no data.

  'Re-read the EXACT evidence pins a transition was decided against, inside the transaction that holds its subject locks, and bind every one of them to the ONE primary subject that transition advances. Any movement, any wrong source or record kind, any wrong author class, any binding naming a different subject, and any manifest that is not exactly one declared alternative refuses the whole coupled transition. Existence is not the check; sameness and identity are. Returns, per pin, the CANONICAL REFERENCE the reader itself named -- F01''s document_id, the stored artifact''s digest, the committed record''s record_id -- and the FACTS read off the stored row (the closing date, the reason), so the writer can compare both the state it is about to write and the history it is about to append against the evidence rather than against the caller.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE ONE TRANSITION WRITER.
--
-- Q082's coupled facts, made structural: every proposed subject and every event
-- lands in ONE transaction or none of them does. There is no partial apply, no
-- per-subject writer a caller could call twice, and no free-form stage update
-- anywhere in this file.
--
-- THE LOCK ORDER IS DECLARED AND ACYCLIC. Every writer here takes locks in
-- exactly this order, and a future writer MUST slot into it:
--
--   tier 1  j102:request:<tenant>:<key>          (j102_replay_outcome; shared
--           with the private claim and re-entrant within one transaction, so a
--           caller that probes for a replay and then writes does not self-block)
--   tier 2  j102:subject:<tenant>:<kind>:<id>    (every subject this transition
--           touches, acquired in ASCENDING kind:id order)
--
-- ASCENDING ORDER IS WHAT MAKES TIER 2 SAFE. Two concurrent transitions touching
-- the same pair of subjects acquire them in the same sequence, so one waits and
-- the other proceeds instead of each holding what the other needs. The ordering
-- is applied to the union of the compare-and-swap operands and the proposed
-- subjects, so a subject that is only READ is locked exactly as one that is
-- written -- a decision taken against an unlocked read is a decision taken
-- against a value that can move underneath it.

  'The ONLY writer of lifecycle state. Admits the transition against the closed SQL admission map first -- the transition must exist, the operation must be one that performs it, and the DERIVED principal class must be permitted -- then claims its idempotency key before reading any state and locks every subject it reads or writes in ascending order. It REFUSES TO CREATE THE PRIMARY SUBJECT: a transition advances a row that is already there, and creation is admitted only for the two coupled subjects the kernel itself creates (an engagement, a pending deal) in their exact shape. It requires a compare-and-swap operand for every proposed subject, the WHOLE coupled subject set rather than any subset, and EXACTLY the event set that transition appends -- so a call can neither erase history with an empty array nor fabricate an extra or wrong-kind event. It re-reads the exact evidence pins under those locks, binds every one of them to the single primary subject, and then checks the RESULT: the prerequisites and instrument kind against the committed row, the evaluator''s own prior conditions, and every field either equal to the exact value the transition computes -- from the stored prior state, the coupled subjects and the evidence facts read under the lock -- or byte-identical to what was committed. THE HISTORY IS CHECKED THE SAME WAY: every subject envelope must name THIS transition as its own established_by_transition, every event''s whole payload -- not only its kind and subject -- must equal what the transition produces from those same facts, and every event must cite EXACTLY the evidence references the recheck actually re-read, derived from the readers'' own answers rather than from the manifest or from any supplied array. Actor, instant, schema versions and tenant are derived or fixed. Then it writes every proposed subject and every event in one transaction or none.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE INITIALIZATION WRITER -- the first row of a chain, and nothing else.
--
-- IT IS A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FROM ops.j102_apply_transition ON PURPOSE, and the
-- separation is the whole safety argument rather than a tidiness preference. The
-- transition writer refuses to create its own primary subject because a created
-- primary makes its `from` axes, its instrument kind and its prior conditions
-- vacuous. Folding creation back in behind a flag would put that bypass one
-- boolean away from returning. So creation lives here, where there is NO
-- transition to have prerequisites: this function performs none, reads none of
-- the transition contracts, and cannot advance a committed row -- it writes one
-- row that did not exist, in a shape the admission map fixes field by field, and
-- refuses if that row is already there.
--
-- WHAT IT CHECKS INSTEAD OF EVIDENCE, since it takes none:
--
--   1. IS IT AN INITIALIZATION AT ALL, may this operation perform it, and may
--      this actor's DERIVED class -- the same three admission questions the
--      transition writer asks, against the same map, before a key is claimed.
--   2. THE PARENT CHAIN, under this transaction's own locks. Every subject the
--      contract requires must be in the compare-and-swap operand map, must still
--      hash to the digest the caller decided against, and must satisfy its
--      declared conditions on the COMMITTED row: an assignment only under an
--      ACTIVE engagement held by a relationship that is already a CLIENT (Q077),
--      a negotiation only under an assignment that is still open (Q095). A chain
--      link the caller simply omits is refused rather than skipped.
--   3. THE CREATED SHAPE, field for field, through the same interpreter the
--      transition targets use. A caller cannot create a relationship that is born
--      a `client`, an assignment born `committed`, a negotiation born
--      `loi_accepted`, or a row carrying an extra key or missing one.
--   4. THAT IT IS A CREATION. The operand for the created key must be an EXPLICIT
--      JSON null -- "this subject must be ABSENT" -- and the compare-and-swap
--      refuses if any row holds that key. Two concurrent initializations of one id
--      take the same advisory lock and serialize on it; AT READ COMMITTED the
--      loser then meets the winner's committed row and gets the named
--      `j102_subject_already_exists`, and at a stronger isolation level its

--      on the subject the contract names, with the exact nested detail computed
--      from the row that was created -- and an EMPTY evidence citation, which is
--      a positive statement that this act rested on none.
--
-- WHAT IT CANNOT DO, structurally: create an engagement or a deal (neither kind
-- appears in the initialization map, because both are COUPLED creations of a
-- transition and creating one here would be a client status or a Deal with no
-- commitment behind it), write a second subject (it takes one envelope), append a
-- second event, touch a committed row, or reach ops.j102_apply_transition.

comment on function ops.j102_initialize_subject(text,jsonb,jsonb,jsonb,text,text,jsonb) is
  'The ONLY writer that creates the first lifecycle subject of a chain, and it performs no transition. It admits the call against the closed SQL admission map''s initialization half -- the initialization must exist, the operation must be one that performs it, and the DERIVED principal class must be permitted -- then claims its idempotency key before reading any state and locks the created key and every parent in ascending order. The created key''s operand must be an EXPLICIT NULL and the compare-and-swap refuses if any row holds it, so two concurrent creations of one id serialize on the shared advisory lock and neither overwrites the other: at READ COMMITTED the loser gets the named j102_subject_already_exists, and at a stronger isolation level its snapshot predates the winner''s commit and the primary key refuses the insert with 23505 instead. Every operand key must be the created subject or a parent this call actually RESOLVED and read, by identity rather than by kind, so no unconsulted row can be locked and then reported as checked; the receipt names the consulted keys, which is empty for a parentless creation. Every parent the contract requires must be in the operand map, must still hash to the digest the caller decided against, and must satisfy its declared conditions on the COMMITTED row -- an ACTIVE engagement held by a CLIENT for an assignment, a still-open assignment for a negotiation. The created row is then held to the contract''s exact shape field by field, so a relationship cannot be born a client, an assignment born committed or a negotiation born accepted; the single event is held to its declared kind, subject and whole nested payload; and its evidence citation must be EXACTLY empty, because no evidence in this rail can bind to a subject that does not exist yet. Actor, instant, schema versions and tenant are derived or fixed. It never touches ops.j102_apply_transition, and that function''s refusal to create its own primary subject is unaffected: every transition prerequisite remains mandatory afterwards.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE RECONCILIATION WRITER -- Q103's visible conflict, written under the same
-- governance every other writer in this file carries.
--
-- THE ONE-ARGUMENT FORM IS REPLACED, NOT SHADOWED. It took an envelope and
-- nothing else: no idempotency key, so a retried request wrote a second visible
-- item; no compare-and-swap operand, so the `current_version_digest` it stored
-- was whatever the caller had read whenever it read it; and no re-read of the
-- subject, so a conflict item could be filed claiming a "current" version that
-- had stopped being current before the insert. An application-level readback
-- cannot close any of that -- it is not atomic, two callers pass it
-- simultaneously, and it cannot tell a stale claim from a fresh one at all. The
-- old signature is DROPPED so no ungoverned overload survives beside this one;
-- `create or replace` alone would have left it callable, and its grants revoked
-- and re-granted below name the new signature.
--
-- WHAT IT NOW BINDS, and each is a fact about the row at COMMIT time rather than
-- at read time:
--
--   1. THE REQUEST. It claims its idempotency key through the same
--      ops.j102_claim_idempotency every sibling uses, so a replay returns the
--      stored outcome and writes nothing, and the same key over DIFFERENT bytes
--      refuses rather than substituting one conflict for another. The claim is
--      tier 1 and is taken before any state is read.
--   2. THE SUBJECT, under the tier-2 advisory lock in the established order, with
--      an explicit compare-and-swap operand. The operand must be the digest the
--      caller decided against AND the digest the row actually holds.
--   3. THE "CURRENT" VERSION THE ITEM CLAIMS. It must equal that same committed
--      digest. A conflict item whose `current_version_digest` is not current is a
--      stale reading filed as a fact, and it is the shape a person resolving the
--      conflict is least able to detect.
--   4. THE STATE SNAPSHOT INSIDE THE ITEM. The evidence the item carries so a
--      human can see what the record says now must HASH to the version it names.
--   5. THE HISTORY EVIDENCE. The newest row of the tail the item carries must
--      still be the newest committed event for that subject.
--   6. THAT THERE IS A CONFLICT AT ALL. A base equal to the current version is
--      not a conflict, and an item recording one would be noise in the one place
--      a person is supposed to look.
--
-- WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: collapse distinct proposals. Two callers, or
-- one caller twice, proposing DIFFERENT edits against the same two versions have
-- raised two real conflicts, and both are visible. Idempotency is keyed on the
-- REQUEST -- which covers the edits -- and on nothing else; there is no unique
-- index over the version pair, deliberately, because one would silently discard
-- the second proposal.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The ungoverned single-argument form holds no data and is removed rather than
-- left callable beside its replacement.

  'Q103: append one VISIBLE, unresolved conflict item, under the same governance every other writer here carries. It claims its idempotency key before reading any state, so a replay returns the stored outcome and the same key over different bytes refuses; it locks the subject in the established tier-2 order and compare-and-swaps it; and it then binds what the item SAYS to what the row IS at commit time -- the current version digest, the state snapshot the item shows and the newest row of its history evidence must all match the committed subject and its committed history, so a reading that went stale between the caller''s read and this insert cannot be filed as a current fact. A base equal to the current version is refused as no conflict at all. It collapses no distinct proposal: idempotency is keyed on the request, which covers the edits, and there is deliberately no unique index over the version pair. IT ALSO REFUSES THE TWO LABELS A DIRECT carr_writer CALLER COULD OTHERWISE INVENT: conflict_kind must be one of the four kinds evaluateConcurrentEdit files, and every edit on BOTH sides must carry the class the policy registry gives that field -- JSON null for a field policy has not classified -- both read out of ops.j102_admission_policy() rather than restated here. visible, applied and resolved_by_machine are compared as JSON BOOLEANS, so a string "false" is not accepted where the boolean is meant.
