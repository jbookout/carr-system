vault-drift-watch.py — vault-write door detection, v2 (Phase 1, 2026-08-13).

The vault ("/Users/booko/My Drive/CARR AI") accepts writes from more than one
actor, and the client-write door from Codex has been demonstrated open. v1 of
this watch was a plain manifest diff: sha256+mtime per tracked .md file,
compared against the previous run. That catches a hand-edit sitting on disk
between two runs, but it CANNOT catch a generated file being clobbered and then
immediately re-clobbered by the same night's export — the exact failure mode
this v2 build was commissioned to close: a nightly chain that rewrites every
generated file is a nightly chain that erases the evidence of any tamper that
happened to a generated file earlier that same day, before this watch ever saw
it. v2 adds a second, independent baseline that survives the rewrite.

THREE THINGS THIS SCRIPT NOW DOES, run as two separate modes:

  --rebaseline (run LAST, after the nightly export chain finishes)
      Snapshots the POST-EXPORT state of every file the live exporters/targets.py
      TARGETS registry knows about: sha256 always, plus a content copy (so a
      later diff has something to diff against) unless the total registered
      content exceeds a size cap, in which case only .md registry files get
      content-copied and everything else (xlsx, json) is hash-only. Written to
      out/vault-drift-baseline/.

  --check (run FIRST, before anything else in the nightly chain)
      Two independent comparisons:
        1. TAMPER — every file in the last --rebaseline's registry is re-hashed
           now. ANY hash difference (or the file having vanished) since that
           baseline is TAMPER: something touched a generated file outside the
           export that is supposed to be its only writer. This is the check v1
           could not do, because v1 only ever compared manifest-to-manifest and
           every manifest already reflected a post-export state.
        2. UNEXPECTED — same walk-and-classify structural diff v1 did, over
           tracked .md files only: any add/modify/delete of a .md file that is
           neither a registered export target nor one of the 54 files already
           content-hash-checked by the doctrine-mirror drift check (see
           tools/corpus-sync.py / corpus/corpus-set.tsv — that check owns those
           54 files; this watch excludes them so the same drift is never
           reported twice by two different scripts) is UNEXPECTED.
      Every TAMPER and UNEXPECTED finding gets salvaged before this run ends:
      quarantine the current file plus a diff against the last known-good
      content, append a well-formed intake payload to a manifest.jsonl, and
      (only if CARR_DRIFT_INGEST=1 is set — OFF by default) POST that payload
      to the Worker's /ingest socket, so a hand-edit that a nightly export is
      about to overwrite has a real chance of reaching the record layer instead
      of just disappearing. See "SALVAGE-THEN-HEAL" below.

A first --check run with no --rebaseline baseline yet skips the tamper
comparison (nothing to compare against) rather than reporting false tamper; a
first --check run with no previous check-manifest is a SEED for the structural
.md comparison, same semantics as v1. Neither counts as drift.

Exit codes (--check): 0 clean, 2 at least one TAMPER or UNEXPECTED finding,
1 FATAL (bad --root). Exit codes (--rebaseline): 0 on success, 1 FATAL.

SALVAGE-THEN-HEAL. The nightly chain's whole design is: overwrite every
generated file with a fresh export every night. If a human (or Codex) hand-
edited a registry file in between, the next export blows that edit away with
no record it ever existed — unless something captures it FIRST. That is what
--check's salvage step is for: quarantine + diff + a manifest line exist for
every finding whether or not live routing is turned on, so nothing is lost even
with CARR_DRIFT_INGEST unset. Turning that flag on is a separate, visible,
human decision — the capability ships disabled.

Run:
  python3 ops/vault-drift-watch.py --check
  python3 ops/vault-drift-watch.py --rebaseline
Test:
  python3 ops/vault-drift-watch.py --check --root <scratch> --manifest <scratch> \\
      --baseline-dir <scratch> --quarantine-dir <scratch> --salvage-manifest <scratch> \\
      --summary <scratch>

# visible in the report. Everything else under the prefix still lands in
# UNEXPECTED, because it is still the real signal the alarm exists for:
#   - hash present in the manifest but does not match current bytes (tamper)
#   - file exists under the mirror with no entry in manifest.json at all
#     (a foreign writer parked it there — the manifest never claimed it)
#   - manifest.json entry for a path with no file on disk (something deleted
#     it after the pipeline's own atomic swap published the tree)
#   - manifest.json itself missing or unreadable (fail visible, never silent)
# A path that vanishes AND has no manifest entry either (the manifest's own
# latest run also stopped producing it — a doctrine document retired from the
# database) is a legitimate structural removal, not tamper; see
# classify_mirror_file below.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe's rule faae6748 forbids deleting a vault file: a
    candidate deletion is MOVED into _to_delete/ instead, in a dated folder
    naming the reason. The monthly sweep obeys that rule, so every retirement
    it makes looks, from this checker's side of the fence, exactly like a
    deletion — the file is gone from its home and _to_delete/ is in SKIP_DIRS,
    so nothing here ever saw where it went.

    On 2026-08-16 that cost a wrong conclusion rather than just a noisy line:
    the nightly reported sweep-sop.md, review-task.md and a July network brief
    as UNEXPECTED deletions, and the session on duty told Joe his monthly sweep
    procedure might have been deleted by something unknown. All three were in
    _to_delete/ the whole time, each in a folder naming its reason.

    Matched on BASENAME, not full path, because staging moves the file into a
    differently-named folder by design — the path cannot match and requiring it
    to would defeat the check. That is deliberately loose, which is why the
    caller applies it to DELETED paths only.
