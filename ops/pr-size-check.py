"""Warn, never block, when a change set is too big or too mixed to review well.

engineering-workflow-sop section 15, "Small incremental changes: the soft
threshold": a PR over 300 changed lines or 5 files outside generated paths, or
one that mixes a refactor with a behavior change, gets a decomposition warning
at the pre-push floor. Warning, not block, until the weekly numbers show what
the distribution actually is.

  * The numbers are the escalation router's own (ops/jev_intake.py
    ROUTE_MAX_DIFF_LINES and ROUTE_MAX_FILES), imported, never copied, so a
    rebase of the threshold happens in one place.
  * Changed lines are added plus deleted, from `git diff -M --numstat` over the
    range (default origin/main...HEAD). A binary file counts as a file with no
    lines.
  * Paths in DECOMPOSITION_EXCLUDED_PATHS are left out of both counts: nobody
    reviews a lockfile line by line. Migrations are NEVER left out, whatever
    their name, because a migration is the change most worth reading.
  * The refactor-mix signal is a predicate, not a judgment: the range holds at
    least one near-pure rename (git similarity >= NEAR_PURE_RENAME) AND some
    other content edit outside the excluded paths. Moves land best alone.
  * It prints nothing when the change set is within the standard, and a short
    stderr block when it is not. It ALWAYS exits 0 and swallows every failure
    inside itself: it is a reporter, not a gate, and the hook discards its exit
    status anyway.
