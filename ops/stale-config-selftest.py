stale-config-selftest.py — acceptance test for ops/stale-config-check.py,
written before the check (rule e65efc68).

THE FAILURE IT PREVENTS, twice on 2026-08-14 and both times damaging.

  ops/ci.sh — pull request 60 added a type-check class that treated a missing
  mypy as SKIP. Pull request 65, cut BEFORE 60 existed, replaced the whole class
  with its own older copy that reported a false failure instead. It merged
  second and won. A machine without mypy then failed CI with "mypy found shape
  mistakes", which is both wrong and a wrong explanation.

  ops/config/gate-baseline.json — pull request 70 changed a gate and re-blessed
  its hash in the same commit, exactly as the baseline's own instructions
  require. A concurrent pull request cut before it blessed from the older base
  and merged after, carrying the pre-70 hash. Main then shipped a gate whose
  recorded hash did not match its own file, so EVERY session booted reporting
  GATE INTEGRITY FAILURE until it was re-blessed by hand.

WHY NOTHING CAUGHT EITHER. Each branch is internally consistent and passes CI on
its own. The conflict does not exist until the two are combined on main, and git
does not report a conflict because the second branch rewrote the whole region.
This is a lost update, not a merge conflict.

WHY THESE FILES SPECIFICALLY. They are GENERATED and rewritten wholesale by
tooling rather than hand-edited line by line, so two branches touching them
almost never conflict textually — they just silently overwrite each other.
ops/config/gate-baseline.json took THIRTY-SIX commits on main in twenty-four
hours. A hand-written source file would have conflicted and been noticed.

THE RULE THE CHECK ENFORCES: if your branch modifies one of these files, the
newest commit on origin/main touching that same file must already be in your
history. Otherwise you are about to overwrite it.

WHAT IT MUST NOT DO, which is most of this file:
  - never fire on a branch that does not touch a watched file
  - never fire when the branch is already current for that file
  - never fire on main itself, where there is nothing to be stale against
  - fail OPEN when it cannot tell (no origin/main, shallow clone, not a repo),
    because a check that blocks every push when git is unavailable is worse than
    the lost update it guards
