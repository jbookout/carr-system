"""prepush-floor-selftest.py — the acceptance test for what ops/githooks/pre-push
runs, and for the plumbing that carries the answer back.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. On 2026-08-23 the gates council moved the full
ten-class ops/ci.sh off the push path and left a fast local floor behind. Doing
that required three changes to the hook whose failure modes are silent:

  1. It now selects classes (`--only pushfloor,secret`). Select the wrong ones
     and the push path checks less than anybody thinks, with no symptom.
  2. It now derives CARR_CI_RANGE from the refs on stdin -- which the owner
     check above it already consumed, so stdin had to be captured and replayed.
     Get that wrong and either the owner check stops seeing main, or the range
     is empty and the secret scan silently widens (safe) or misreads (not).
  3. It now TEEs the run so the failure text can be attributed. A shell pipeline
     reports the status of its LAST command, and tee always succeeds, so the
     obvious spelling of this makes EVERY RED PUSH GREEN. That is the single
     worst outcome available in this file and it leaves no trace.

None of those is caught by "the checks pass". They are caught by asserting what
the hook invoked and what it did with the answer, which is what this does.

HOW. The unit under test is the HOOK, not ops/ci.sh, so the fixture installs a
STUB ci.sh that records its arguments and environment and exits with whatever
status the case wants. A real suite here would test ci.sh twice and this file's
actual subject not at all.

The fixture is built outside the checkout with ops/git_env.fixture_env(), per
ops/selftest-git-isolation-check.py -- and pointedly so, because this file is
run by ops/ci.sh which is run by this very hook.
