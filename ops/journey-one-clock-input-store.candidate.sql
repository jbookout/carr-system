-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-M01: the durable append-only ADMITTED-MINIMUM INPUT
-- HISTORY the Journey 1 clock projection's `minimum_history` is read from
-- (requirement Q008, decision Q008.D1; gate foundation-assurance-minimum-accepted).
--
-- CANDIDATE SQL. This file is source, not a migration. It carries no migration
-- ledger preflight, is not listed in public.schema_migrations, creates no role,
-- creates no schema, and is not applied to Production by anything in this slice.
-- Landing it as a numbered migration is a separate, Joe-gated act. IT HAS NEVER
-- BEEN EXECUTED.
--
-- PREREQUISITES, exact rather than implied. This file is FRESH-OR-EXACTLY-
-- COMPATIBLE: every relation is `create table if not exists` with no ALTER and
-- no backfill anywhere. It reuses, read-only and without restating:
--   * ops.j1_clock_scope_digest(jsonb), ops.j1_clock_origin_gate_id() and
--     ops.j1_clock_assert_same(...) from ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql
--     -- THE ONE scope derivation. A second scope key here would file one
--     program's inputs and one program's clock under two different addresses,
--     and the uniqueness both rails rely on would silently hold over two sets.
--     That file is also candidate source and has never been applied, so this
--     one cannot be applied before it.
--   * ops.portfolio_canonical_json(jsonb) from migration 0496 -- the ONE
--     canonicalizer, already reconciled against artifact-trust.js's canonicalJson.
--   * ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id() -- the ONE server-established writer.
--   * public.digest(bytea, text) from pgcrypto, and public.actor.
-- Every object created below is namespaced `ops.j1_minimum_*`. Nothing outside
-- that prefix is created, altered or dropped.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS IS. journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql stores what the kernel
-- COMPUTES. This file stores what the kernel READS: the inventory of admitted
-- foundation-assurance-minimum receipts whose FIRST admission the kernel selects
-- an origin from.
--
-- THE ADMISSION INSTANT IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS DERIVED HERE.
-- journey-one-clock.v5.js selects the origin by ADMISSION ORDER because "an
-- append-only inventory can only ever gain LATER admissions", and warns that
-- selecting on observed_at instead "would let that ordinary admission rebase a
-- running clock, which is not a repairable state". That guarantee is this
-- file's to provide:
--   * `admitted_at` comes from ops.j1_minimum_admission_instant(), which is
--     now() -- the TRANSACTION timestamp -- rendered in the kernel's instant
--     grammar. A caller may name it; ops.j1_minimum_append_admission only ever
--     compares the named value against the one it derives, and because now() is
--     stable within a transaction the two are one reading rather than two.
--   * The ledger is stored IN THE KERNEL'S OWN SELECTION ORDER -- admitted_at
--     non-decreasing, receipt digest strictly increasing within one admitted_at
--     group -- and an append only ever extends it. The kernel orders candidates
--     by (admitted_at, receipt_digest) and takes the first ELIGIBLE one, so a
--     row that sorts after every stored row cannot be preferred to any of them
--     and cannot take the origin from the row that already has it. Comparing
--     against the FIRST ROW would not do it: that row may be an inadmissible
--     attempt the kernel skips. This file computes no eligibility.
--
-- IT IS NOT A SECOND RECEIPT VALIDATOR AND NOT A SECOND BENCHMARK. It checks
-- the FATAL-in-kernel bindings it can check from the accepted source bindings
-- this inventory was sealed under -- producer step, gate, role, oracle, scope,
-- environment manifest, window against the accepted policy, and the admission
-- instant against the receipt's own observation. It does not judge a receipt's
-- internal seat independence: that is enforced where the receipt is PROPOSED,
-- in benchmark-minimum.v5.js's join, and refused by name by the kernel.
--
-- WHAT IS REFUSED AND WHAT IS STORED. The kernel calls a non-passing receipt,
-- and one whose window has lapsed, "an ordinary fact of the ledger". Both are
-- STORED here. This rail has no filter and no discard path; the kernel decides
-- what may become an origin. Everything the kernel treats as FATAL is refused
-- at admission, because one such row makes every later evaluation of the
-- inventory refuse and an append-only inventory cannot shed it.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT A DIRECT SQL WRITER CAN AND CANNOT DO, SAID PLAINLY.
--
-- Direct INSERT is granted to nobody. Every write goes through
-- ops.j1_minimum_append_admission(), which derives its own actor, its own
-- admission instant and every digest. But that function is reachable by any
-- holder of the writer bundle, and a holder who calls it directly can STORE AN
-- ASSERTION: a receipt object it composed itself rather than one an authenticated
-- producer issued. This database cannot tell the two apart and does not pretend
-- to. No column here is named verified, accepted, admissible or issued;
-- `input_authority` is pinned by a CHECK to the single value
-- `trusted_admission_not_independently_verified_by_this_record_layer`, and
-- ops.j1_minimum_record_layer_cannot_prove() says so on every readback.
--
-- WHAT THE DATABASE *DOES* PROVE, independently of any writer: that a stored
-- receipt rebuilds to the digest it was admitted under; that the admission
-- instant was this database's own and is at or after the receipt's observation;
-- that one authoritative scope holds one inventory whose accepted policy and
-- environment manifest were sealed at its first admission; that the chain names
-- the exact head; that no receipt was admitted twice; that one idempotency key
-- carries one payload; that the stored sequence is in the kernel's own
-- (admitted_at, receipt_digest) selection order -- checked on write against the
-- head and again over the whole sequence on read -- so no append can displace
-- the row the kernel already selected as the origin; and that update, delete and
-- truncate are refused everywhere.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE INVARIANT IDS BELOW ARE SHARED WITH THE MODULE ON PURPOSE.
-- mcp-server/src/journey-one-clock-input-store.v5.js exports
-- JOURNEY_ONE_MINIMUM_ADMISSION_INVARIANTS, one entry per rule, and every id in
-- it appears verbatim in a refusal message here. The unit suite reads this file
-- and asserts each id is present. That is a real, mechanical comparison between
-- two homes of one rule set. It does NOT prove this SQL is correct: nothing that
-- has never run can prove that. Both homes exist because neither can replace the
-- other -- a direct SQL writer never executes the JavaScript, and the module's
-- reference journal has no database.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK, named rather than implied:
--   * Applying this file, and ops/journey-one-clock-store.candidate.sql before
--     it, as numbered migrations.
--   * The ISSUANCE ADAPTER. benchmark-minimum.v5.js proposes a minimum receipt
--     and marks it proposed_not_issued; nothing issues one, so no genuine
--     artifact can reach this rail and no clock has been started.
--   * The GATE ZERO and BENCHMARK COVERAGE bindings. consumer-gate-receipt.v1
--     carries neither and M01's projection has no slot for either, so this file
--     deliberately stores neither: a column filled from a caller would mint the
--     binding rather than carry it. It stays an explicit blocker.
--   * Running mcp-server/test/journey-one-clock-input-store-postgres.sql. It has
--     never been executed.
