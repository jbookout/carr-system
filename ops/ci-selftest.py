"""ci-selftest.py — proves ops/ci.sh actually runs, refuses, and reports honestly.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is embarrassing that it did not exist first. Every
other gate in this repo has a selftest. ops/ci.sh — the script that gates all the
others — shipped with none, and inside one afternoon it accumulated four defects
that were each found by RUNNING it rather than by testing it:

  1. ${STRICT:+--strict} expanded on STRICT=0, because :+ fires on any non-empty
     value and "0" is non-empty. --strict leaked into every local run.
  2. `declare -A` is bash 4; macOS ships bash 3.2.57, so the script died on line
     64 before running a single check.
  3. Under zsh, `for c in $CLASS_ORDER` does not word-split, so the loop ran ONCE
     with c set to the whole list, every check_$c was an unknown command, and the
     script still reached its success line and printed "CI passed — every class
     green". EIGHT CLASSES REPORTED GREEN, ZERO EXECUTED. Caught by a peer
     session, not by me.
  4. core.fileMode is false in this repo, so chmod +x never reached the index.
     ci.sh was 100644 in git, and CI died with exit 126 — found but not
     executable.

Case 3 is the one that matters most and the reason this file leads with it. A
promotion gate that reports green having run nothing is worse than no gate: it
converts "unverified" into "verified" silently, and every downstream claim
inherits the lie. Defects 1, 2 and 4 make the script fail loudly, which is
survivable. Defect 3 makes it succeed falsely.

The rule this file is the answer to (Joe, 2026-08-13, from Addy Osmani): write
the tests first, then the code that makes them pass. Applied late here, on
purpose, to the exact artifact that proved why.

# must never be normalised by habitually passing CARR_SKIP_CI on every push.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- seed safety
# THIS FILE SEEDS REAL DAMAGE INTO THE LIVE WORKING TREE — that is the point of
# it, because a check is only proven by making it fail. The danger is what
# happens if the process does not reach its own cleanup line.
#
# It already did happen, on 2026-08-13 (loop #368). A seeded defect was left
# behind — the `state-as-of` verb missing from mcp-server/src/tools.js, 46
# deletions in one hunk — and the marker file that would have said so had
# already been removed. ops/ci.sh --only artifact then failed with "would REMOVE
# 1 verb(s): deployed 105, tree has 104", and because the pre-push hook runs the
# full ci.sh, that blocked EVERY session on this machine from pushing anything,
# for a reason unrelated to their own work. The failure names a verb deletion,
# so the natural first read is that a person deleted a verb on purpose.
#
# WHY try/finally IS NOT ENOUGH, which is what this file relied on before.
# `finally` runs on an exception and on a normal exit. It does NOT run on
# SIGKILL, on a machine losing power, or when a parent harness kills the process
# group on timeout — and a CI selftest is exactly the kind of long job something
# else kills. A harness that seeds real damage and relies on reaching its own
# cleanup line is one crash away from doing this again.
#
# WHAT REPLACES IT. The original bytes are written to a JOURNAL BEFORE anything
# is modified, and the journal is removed only after a successful restore. So
# the damage is never un-recorded: either the journal is absent (nothing is
# seeded) or it names every path and holds its original content. Recovery then
# needs no memory of what the run was doing.
#
#   * seeded_paths() restores on any ordinary exit path — normal, exception,
#     SIGINT, SIGTERM — via finally plus atexit plus signal handlers.
#   * On a kill that outruns all of those, the journal survives on disk, and the
#     NEXT run finds it, restores every path from it, and REFUSES to start.
#     Refusing matters: a run that silently repaired and continued would hide a
#     crash that has already cost this machine a full push outage once.

    commit message records that its first attempt at that proof was a FALSE PASS.
    The seed was appended to tools/health-check.py, whose module body ends in

    mypy does not check unreachable code, and so the test measured dead code

    ops/ci.sh collects with shell globs, and those globs have been narrower than
    the tree three times now. Shell tests under tools/ were "collected by nobody
    and executed by nothing" until a second loop was added for them. Then three

    test_staging_recovery_rehearsal and test_displacement_turn_filter — never
    executed once between being committed and 2026-08-27, because the Python
    loop globbed only tools/test-*.py.

    THE THIRD TIME WAS THIS CHECK ITSELF, found 2026-09-10. It asserted the
    invariant against a tree it enumerated with `(REPO/"tools").glob(...)` and
    `(REPO/"ops").glob(...)` — two directory globs, ONE LEVEL DEEP, the very
    shape of the defect it existed to catch. tools/room-bridge/ held fifteen

# ------------------------------------- 5b. what a failing gate is allowed to print
#
# fail_tail() prints a CHILD PROCESS'S captured output into the CI log. The
# window was widened on 2026-09-11 from twelve lines to the whole log under 200
# lines, because the failing line of a 32-check suite sat above a twelve-line
# tail and two hosted rounds were spent unable to read it. Widening the window
# widened the exposure with it: arbitrary child stdout, into a log that outlives
# the run and that more people can read than can read the tree.
#
# So both halves are asserted here — the window, which is the feature, and the
# redaction, which is what the feature costs if it is missing. The redaction is
# ops/ci-secret-scan.py's own --redact filter over its own PATTERNS list; these
# cases prove the wiring, and the scanner's pattern list stays the one place a
# shape is declared.

# A real github-token shape, present in this file ON PURPOSE so the assertions
# below are about a string the scanner genuinely matches rather than a stand-in
# that only looks like one. It is inert: 36 characters counting up.

#   name shape alone, and the name shape is not the pairing: 31 of 314

    edited into a shape its own acceptance test rejects and the push sails past.

    The gate path is pure diff text and is never written: the floor derives the

    class's tree fingerprint excludes untracked files by design, so this case
    cannot move the fingerprint of the class it runs inside.
