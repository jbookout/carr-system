"""codex-hook-smoke-selftest.py — regression fixtures for the Codex hook
smoke (ops/codex-hook-smoke.sh) and the flag that makes it mean anything.

THREE THINGS THIS CHECKS, none of which requires a live Codex run (a real run
takes real wall-clock time and burns real usage, so CI runs this instead):

  1. THE JUDGE FUNCTION. ops/codex_hook_smoke_judge.py's judge() must call
     captured denial text PASS and a curl-error/empty/wrong-host shape FAIL,
     and its diagnose() must tell apart the three ways a run can fail to
     produce a denial. This is the part of the smoke that is a pure function
     and can actually be unit-tested. diagnose() carries the 2026-08-18
     regression: Codex refusing the probe itself was reported as a skipped
     hook, which pointed three nights of investigation at the wrong thing.

  2. SAME INVOCATION HELPER (rule a8c55a47). ops/codex-hook-smoke.sh must
     source bin/council-lib.sh and call one of its run_* functions rather
     than hand-rolling its own `codex exec` invocation — otherwise the smoke
     tests a code path bin/precheck.sh and bin/council.sh do not actually use,
     and a drift between the two would go undetected. Static grep, same
     technique bin/precheck.sh's own --selftest uses to confirm the model
     pins are sourced rather than redeclared.

  3. THE FLAG ITSELF IS PRESENT AT EVERY SANCTIONED SITE. This is the
     regression test for the thing this whole build exists to fix:
     --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust must be on run_codex, run_precheck (both
     in bin/council-lib.sh) and build_codex_command (in
     pipelines/run_codex_review.py). Without it, Codex silently skips every
     PreToolUse hook on an unattended run — verified live 2026-08-14, no
     denial, no warning — so a regression here is a silent regression in
     production, exactly the failure mode this file exists to catch instead.
