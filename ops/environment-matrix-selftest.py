environment-matrix-selftest.py — the environment matrix has to match the repo.

WHAT P0-2 ASKS FOR: "Local/Rehearsal/Staging/Production matrix with isolated
identities, Neon, KV/R2, domains, secrets, and telemetry", and a "drift report
[that] names every intentional difference." The matrix is now written down in
ops/config/environments.json. A written matrix that nothing checks is a diagram,
so this is the half that makes it a control.

THE RULE THE FILE STATES AND THIS ENFORCES: every difference between two
environments is either INTENTIONAL and named, or it is drift. There is no third
category. An unlisted difference fails here rather than being noticed later by
somebody wondering why staging behaves oddly.

WHY THIS RUNS IN CI RATHER THAN NIGHTLY. It compares two things that both live
in the repository — the matrix and mcp-server/wrangler.toml plus the project map
in tools/db-tap.py — so it needs no credential and no network, and ops/ci.sh
picks it up automatically as a *-selftest.py. The nightly gates
(p1-environment-gate, p1-rebuild-gate) ask the live environments the questions
that need live answers. These are the questions a change can be checked against
before it merges.

THE ASSERTIONS.

  1. ALL FOUR ENVIRONMENTS ARE DECLARED. The Program 0 inventory found local
     "implicit and defined nowhere" and development non-existent; a matrix
     missing an environment is how that state persisted.
  2. EVERY DECLARED WORKER MATCHES wrangler.toml, by name, for the environments
     that deploy one — and the ones that do not deploy declare no name.
  3. PRODUCTION IS PINNED BY ID AND STAGING IS RESOLVED BY NAME, matching
     tools/db-tap.py. Reversing these is the single worst mistake the project
     map could make, so the matrix and the code have to agree out loud.
  4. DECLARED DOMAINS MATCH THE WORKER CONFIG, in both directions. A domain in
     the matrix that wrangler does not serve is fiction; a route wrangler serves
     that the matrix does not name is an undeclared production surface.
  5. EVERY OBSERVED STAGING-VS-PRODUCTION BINDING DIFFERENCE IS NAMED. Matched
     by keyword against intentional_differences, which is deliberately a loose
     match: the point is that a human wrote a sentence about it, not that the
     sentence has a particular shape.
