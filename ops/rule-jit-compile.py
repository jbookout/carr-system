"""rule-jit-compile.py — compile ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json from its
declared inputs, never by hand (WR-000019 slice S9).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Slice S9 generalizes the pre-tool-call rule-delivery rail
(hooks/rule-pack-preuse-reselection.py) beyond its one proven shape — an exact
top-level `run_in_background: true` Bash/functions.exec call bound to the
`scheduled-automation` pack — to a declarative trigger table covering MCP verb
calls, Bash command families, file-path writes, and a general content fallback.
That table is a COMPILED artifact, the same discipline rule-triage.v1.json
itself follows (S7's own docstring: "no rule was retired, amended, or taught by
producing this file") and the same reasoning rule a8c55a47 states for any
derived-vs-source pair: a manual and an automated path producing the same
shape must be the same code, so this script is the ONLY writer of
ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json.

INPUTS, all read-only and already reviewed elsewhere:
  ops/config/rule-triage.v1.json       — jit-home rows carry an optional
                                          `detector` field (kind, pattern),
                                          seeded for ~49 of the 126 JIT rules
                                          across five priority lanes (deal/LOI,
                                          vendor intros, council procedure,
                                          source study, comms) plus engineering
                                          git, using each rule's own
                                          jit_trigger_hint content. An optional
                                          top-level `fallback_narrowing` object
                                          (written only by
                                          ops/rule-delivery-adjudication-apply.py)
                                          strips proven false-positive keywords
                                          out of a pack's fallback pattern.
  ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json — read-only for two things: `rule_packs`
                                          (the existing keyword lists, reused
                                          verbatim as the CONTENT of a pack's
                                          fallback trigger — this script never
                                          edits this file) and
                                          `rule_load_layers[id].packs` (JIT-rule
                                          pack membership, for building the
                                          fallback bucket).

OUTPUT SHAPE (ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json), one row per trigger:
  {
    "trigger_id":  stable 12-hex id, sha256(kind + "|" + pattern)[:12] —
                   independent of which rules are attached, so it does not
                   change when a rule's home moves or a pack's roster shifts.
    "kind":        "verb" | "bash_family" | "path_pattern" | "content_regex".
    "pattern":     interpretation depends on kind (see the hook for exact
                   matching semantics):
                     verb          — regex tested against payload.tool_name
                     bash_family   — regex tested against
                                     tool_input.command, only for
                                     tool_name in {Bash, functions.exec}
                     path_pattern  — fnmatch glob tested against any
                                     file_path/path/notebook_path key found
                                     in tool_input
                     content_regex — regex (lookaheads welcome) tested
                                     against a serialized blob of tool_name
                                     plus tool_input, the general fallback
    "packs":       pack name(s) this trigger is understood to represent
                   (informational — the delivered rule set is the merge of
                   every trigger a call matches, not scoped per-pack at
                   delivery time).
    "rule_ids":    sorted short rule ids, capped at `max_rules_per_trigger`
                   (5) — the over-delivery bias lives in MATCHING liberally,
                   not in raising this cap; context stays lean by design.
    "source":      "seeded_detector"   — from a rule-triage detector field
                   "pack_fallback"     — the remaining un-seeded JIT rules
                                         of one pack, bucketed under that
                                         pack's own keyword list (narrowed
                                         by fallback_narrowing when present)
                   "structural_extra"  — a small, explicit, hand-reviewed
                                         list of non-JIT (gate-home)
                                         structural triggers this compiler
                                         still emits on purpose (see
                                         STRUCTURAL_EXTRA_TRIGGERS below);
                                         these are NOT derived from a triage
                                         detector field because gate-home
                                         rules are not triaged for one.
  }

DETERMINISM. Same inputs, byte-identical output, every time: rows are sorted
by (kind, pattern), rule_ids within a row are sorted, and the file is written
with sort_keys=True. `--check` recompiles in memory and diffs against the
committed file without writing, so CI can catch a hand-edit or a stale commit
(the same role rule-triage-selftest.py's own checks play for its file).

USAGE:
  ops/rule-jit-compile.py            # (re)write ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json
  ops/rule-jit-compile.py --check    # verify the committed file is exactly
                                      # what these inputs compile to; exit 1 on drift
