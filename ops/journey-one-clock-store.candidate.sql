-- DoctorCRE v5 slice V5-M01: durable append-only storage for the Journey 1
-- clock history, with exact prior-history compare-and-swap (requirement Q008,
-- decision Q008.D1; gates journey-one-preactivation-contract-bound and
-- journey-one-production-accepted).
--
-- CANDIDATE SQL. This file is source, not a migration. It carries no migration
-- ledger preflight, is not listed in public.schema_migrations, creates no role,
-- creates no schema, and is not applied to Production by anything in this slice.
-- Landing it as a numbered migration is a separate, Joe-gated act. IT HAS NEVER
-- BEEN EXECUTED: the local initdb is blocked (shmget), and no remote database
-- was used as a workaround.
--
-- PREREQUISITES, exact rather than implied. This file is FRESH-OR-EXACTLY-
-- COMPATIBLE: every relation is `create table if not exists` with no ALTER and
-- no backfill anywhere, so applying it to a database that already carries these
-- relations changes no row. It reuses, read-only and without restating:
--   * ops.portfolio_canonical_json(jsonb) from migration 0496 -- the ONE
--     canonicalizer, already reconciled against artifact-trust.js's
--     canonicalJson. A clock-local copy would be a second canonicalization
--     authority, and two canonicalizers that agree today are two that can
--     disagree after one edit.
--   * ops.portfolio_writer_actor_id() -- the ONE server-established writer
--     derivation. Its name is historical; its contract is "the active actor the
--     server established for this transaction".
--   * public.digest(bytea, text) from pgcrypto, and public.actor.
-- Every object created below is namespaced `ops.j1_clock_*`. Nothing outside
-- that prefix is created, altered or dropped.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS IS. mcp-server/src/journey-one-clock.v5.js is a pure kernel and says
-- so: "Returning a history does not claim it was persisted; the caller owns the
-- durable append", and "ANTI-ROLLBACK LIVES IN THAT ADAPTER, not here ... an
-- OLDER GENUINE history replays unless the durable store compare-and-swaps on
-- the exact prior history_digest and refuses a write whose prior does not match
-- the stored one." This file is the durable half of that adapter: the clock
-- state decomposed into typed rows, an append-only revision chain, and a
-- compare-and-swap that makes an older genuine history unwritable.
--
-- IT IS NOT A SECOND DEADLINE POLICY. No function here computes a deadline,
-- selects an origin, judges a receipt, counts a pause hour or decides a status.
-- The Chicago calendar rule, the 120-hour pre-approved blocker-pause union, the
-- sticky miss and the "late kernel receipt stays usable, deadline success is
-- never claimed after a recorded miss" reading all live in the kernel. This file
-- transports them and refuses to store a record that contradicts the one of
-- them Q008.D1 states outright.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE ROWS ARE THE RECORD, AND THE DIGEST IS RECOMPUTED FROM THEM. The
-- twenty-one fields of doctorcre-v5-journey-one-clock.v2 are stored as
-- eighteen scalar columns plus two ordered child relations (the pause intervals
-- and the event chain). ops.j1_clock_history_preimage() rebuilds the state from
-- those rows and ops.j1_clock_history_digest() hashes it, so the stored
-- history_digest is a statement about the PERSISTED history rather than about a
-- blob a caller once supplied. A caller may name a digest; it is only ever
-- compared against the one the rows produce.
--
-- EVERY HISTORY INSTANT IS STORED AS EXACT TEXT, NOT AS timestamptz, AND THAT IS
-- NOT AN OVERSIGHT. The kernel copies each pause interval's `ends_at` off the
-- projection WITHOUT normalizing it, so `...T00:00:00Z` and `...T00:00:00+00:00`
-- are two different stored values naming one instant, and only the exact one
-- reproduces the digest a partner's ledger carries. A round trip through
-- timestamptz would return a different STRING and therefore a different
-- history_digest. The one timestamptz on this rail is `recorded_at`, which is
-- SERVER TIME and belongs to the record layer, not to the history.
--
-- SERVER TIME AND KERNEL TIME ARE TWO COLUMNS AND NEVER SUBSTITUTE FOR EACH
-- OTHER. `evaluated_at` is the instant the KERNEL evaluated at -- it comes from
-- the verified projection's `as_of` and a caller therefore influences it.
-- `recorded_at` is `now()` in this database. A caller-chosen as_of is never this
-- record layer's clock, and no ordering rule below is decided by as_of alone.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT A DIRECT SQL WRITER CAN AND CANNOT DO, SAID PLAINLY, BECAUSE THE
-- TEMPTATION TO OVERSTATE IT IS THE WHOLE RISK ON THIS RAIL.
--
-- Direct INSERT is granted to nobody. Every write goes through
-- ops.j1_clock_append_revision(), which derives its own actor and enforces every
-- invariant from the persisted rows. But that function is reachable by any
-- holder of the writer bundle, and a holder who calls it directly can STORE AN
-- ASSERTION: a state object it composed itself rather than one the kernel
-- produced. This database cannot tell the two apart, and it does not pretend to.
--
-- WHAT THE DATABASE THEREFORE DOES *NOT* CLAIM about any stored revision:
--   * that the origin receipt was a genuine current passing
--     foundation-assurance-minimum receipt (there is no authenticated admission
--     ledger here, and admitted_at is a projection fact);
--   * that the recorded pauses were approved by a verified partner strictly
--     before they started, or were not backdated;
--   * that the terminus receipt was admitted under the accepted per-receipt TTL
--     policy against the accepted kernel scope;
--   * that the projection the kernel read was authentic;
--   * ANYTHING WHATEVER ABOUT DEADLINE SUCCESS. A stored `completed_on_time` is
--     a recorded computation. IT IS NOT AN ACCEPTANCE OF A DEADLINE BY THIS
--     RECORD LAYER, and ops.j1_clock_record_layer_cannot_prove() says so on
--     every readback. No column here is named verified, accepted, admitted or
--     deadline_success, and `input_authority` is pinned by a CHECK to the single
--     value `trusted_projection_not_independently_verified_by_this_record_layer`
--     so no writer can widen it.
--
-- WHAT THE DATABASE *DOES* PROVE, independently of any writer:
--   * the stored history rebuilds from its own rows to the digest it is filed
--     under, at commit and on every read;
--   * the clock a revision was appended to is the one its OWN PRESENTED ORIGIN
--     derives -- ops.j1_clock_identity_digest() over the tenant, the origin
--     receipt digest, the origin instant and the origin benchmark manifest
--     digest. A caller cannot pick a name; `clock_ref` is a legibility label
--     with no authority, is set once, and selects nothing. A caller inventing a
--     fresh alias for a clock that already has history gets a refusal, not a
--     fresh clock. THAT IS A STATEMENT ABOUT ALIASES AND ABOUT NOTHING ELSE: a
--     caller who presents a DIFFERENT origin derives a different key, and a
--     different key has no head, so its creation meets no compare-and-swap at
--     all. The scope binding below is what refuses that, and this file does not
--     claim the derived key ever did;
--   * that one AUTHORITATIVE CLOCK SCOPE holds at most one clock --
--     ops.j1_clock_scope_binding, keyed by a scope digest derived from the
--     accepted scope's own fields, unique on both sides. A second origin
--     presented for a scope that already names a clock is refused by name and
--     by constraint. WHAT THE DATABASE CANNOT SAY ABOUT IT: that the supplied
--     scope is the accepted scope of the projection the kernel read. The stored
--     state carries no subject, candidate or policy digest, so there is nothing
--     here to derive it from; the scope is compared, never verified, and
--     ops.j1_clock_record_layer_cannot_prove() says so on every readback;
--   * the append named the EXACT current head, or an explicit NULL that succeeds
--     only against a clock with no revisions;
--   * the origin, the base deadline it produced and the completion seals are
--     identical in every revision; a recorded miss is never removed; the prior
--     event chain is an exact prefix of the next;
--   * one idempotency key carries one payload;
--   * update, delete and truncate are refused everywhere on this rail.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE INVARIANT IDS BELOW ARE SHARED WITH THE MODULE ON PURPOSE.
-- mcp-server/src/journey-one-clock-store.v5.js exports
-- JOURNEY_ONE_CLOCK_APPEND_INVARIANTS, one entry per rule, and every id in it
-- appears verbatim in a refusal message here. The unit suite reads this file and
-- asserts each id is present. That is a real, mechanical comparison between two
-- homes of one rule set -- it proves neither home dropped an entry. It does NOT
-- prove this SQL is correct: nothing that has never run can prove that, and this
-- file has never run. Both homes exist because neither can replace the other --
-- a direct SQL writer never executes the JavaScript, and the module's reference
-- journal has no database.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT REMAINS INTEGRATION WORK, named rather than implied:
--   * Applying this file as a numbered migration.
--   * The authenticated projection reader, the admitted-minimum ledger and the
--     terminus producer. Until they exist, the only writer of a KERNEL-PRODUCED
--     revision is trusted server code holding a real verifier; see
--     JOURNEY_ONE_CLOCK_INPUT_AUTHORITY_REQUIREMENT in the module.
--   * Running mcp-server/test/journey-one-clock-store-postgres.sql. It has never
--     been executed.
