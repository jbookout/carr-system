"""worktree-attribution-selftest.py — prove ops/worktree-attribution.py names the
right session, and says UNKNOWN rather than guessing when it cannot.

WHY A HERMETIC FIXTURE AND NOT THE LIVE MACHINE. The first attempt at proving
this ran against the real worktrees on Joe's Mac: pick a file another session has
modified, attribute it, check the name. It passed once and then failed, because
between the two git calls that session committed and its tree went clean. With
thirty-five concurrent worktrees the live machine is not a fixture, it is
weather. So this builds its own repository with its own worktrees and asserts
against a state it controls.

The fixture is built OUTSIDE the checkout with ops/git_env.fixture_env(), per
ops/selftest-git-isolation-check.py: a test that creates a git repository must
scrub the location variables, because GIT_DIR is exported into every hook and
outranks cwd. That is not hypothetical here — this file is run BY ops/ci.sh,
which is run BY ops/githooks/pre-push, which is exactly the path that put 801
staged files on the shared main on 2026-08-13.
