"""release-abandon-selftest.py — a release can be ended without shipping, and it
has to say why. Fixtures written before the verb (rule e65efc68).

WHAT PROMPTED IT. The first real releases went through ops.release on 2026-08-16
and left two candidates behind — one overtaken when main moved two commits before
Joe signed, one replaced by a version carrying the security evidence the approval
constraint requires. Both are inert: they cannot ship, because a deploy needs a
live approval matching a freshly recomputed plan hash. But nothing could move
them out of `candidate`, so the table kept two rows whose real status lived only
in a decision entry.

WHY `abandoned` AND NOT `superseded`, settled by the schema rather than by
preference. 0131 exempts only draft/candidate/abandoned from needing rebuild
evidence and an approval, so reaching `superseded` requires a full artifact
digest, dependency lock, plan hash, approver and expiry — a release that was
APPROVED, and usually one that shipped and was replaced by a later deploy. An
unapproved candidate overtaken before signing has none of that. It is abandoned,
and its reason names the successor in words.

WHAT MUST NOT BECOME POSSIBLE. Abandoning is a way to end a release, never a way
to erase one that shipped. A row that reached approved-and-deployed is history;
letting it be marked abandoned would let a deploy be written out of the record
after the fact, which is the opposite of what a release ledger is for.

WHERE THESE RUN. They need a Postgres carrying the schema and nothing more —
NOT Neon specifically. CI supplies a disposable loopback PostgreSQL service via
CARR_CI_DATABASE_URL. A developer push without that explicit fixture DSN does
not substitute a metered Neon branch: it reports the database cases as not run,
while hosted CI executes them against its already-running local service.
