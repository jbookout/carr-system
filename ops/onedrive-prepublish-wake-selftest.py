"""ops/onedrive-prepublish-wake-selftest.py — asserts the nightly-exports
fix for the 9/22-9/24 OneDrive File Provider defect is actually wired in,
rather than merely present as files nothing calls.

Covers, cheaply and without a database or a live OneDrive mount:
  * ops/onedrive-prepublish-wake.py runs standalone, single-attempt, and
    exits 0 even when every target is absent (a cold/empty provider must
    never fail this step — see its own docstring).
  * bin/nightly.sh actually calls it, BEFORE the exports step, and wraps the
    exports step itself in `caffeinate -i -s`.
  * bin/step-timeout.zsh bounds the new step with its OWN short external
    wall-clock, strictly shorter than the exports step's — a step meant to
    buy the real wait a head start must never be allowed to eat into it.
  * bin/nightly-exports-retry.sh (the daytime safety net) parses, and uses
    the words-not-a-function-call shape carr_routine_exec requires (see
    bin/step-timeout.zsh's own carr_step_timeout_prefix docstring) rather
    than repeating the env -i / zsh-function mistake that bug fix started
    from.
  * The new launchd plist parses with plistlib and uses StartCalendarInterval,
    not StartInterval (StartInterval jobs have been observed to never fire on
    this Mac).
