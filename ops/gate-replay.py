"""gate-replay.py — run every hook gate over the committed replay fixtures and
compare the verdicts with a committed snapshot.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Defect class capability-reported-live-before-first-human-use
recurred eight times. Twice in one day a gate shipped green on invented input:
PR #1224's Stop gate parsed a transcript shape production never writes and
never fired on 803 real receipts; PR #1225's shell regexes were proven only on
made-up commands and a replay of 12,145 real ones found 62 false denials. The
first attempt at this check (the earlier version of PR #1226) tried to prove
coverage by reading selftest SOURCE TEXT against a diff from a base ref. An
Opus review found it a no-op in CI (the base ref did not exist in the runner
and git errors were swallowed), satisfiable by a comment, blind to imports and
config, and wrong about its own fixture counts. This replaces it with
behaviour, not text.

WHAT IT DOES, EVERY RUN, WITH NOTHING COMPUTED FROM A BASE REF:

  1. LEAK SCAN. Every file under the fixture directory and every fixture file
     the manifest names (any extension, `#` comment lines included), the
     manifest, and the verdict snapshot are scanned with
     ops/business_data_patterns.py: its shape patterns AND the real client
     roster (a local roster where one exists, the committed salted hashes of
     it everywhere). Any hit fails. No roster at all fails. The repository is
     public.
  2. MANIFEST COVERAGE. ops/config/gate-replay-manifest.json must name every
     hooks/*.py file (gate, helper, or wrapper). Every hook wiring in
     ops/config/hooks.json, .claude/settings.json and the tracked project
     settings under claude-tree/settings/ must appear as a manifest wiring
     with the same event and matcher, and every manifest wiring, no_replay
     ones included, must still exist there. no_replay is allowed only on
     SessionStart. A fixture set a wiring names must contain records its
     matcher actually selects.
  3. REPLAY. Each wiring's fixtures are fed to the gate as the harness feeds
     them: `python hooks/hook-meter-run.py hooks/<gate>.py` in a subprocess,
     the hook's JSON contract on stdin. The verdict is read from the telemetry
     line hook-meter-run.py itself writes (outcome, register, reopen,
     deny_class), so this check classifies exactly as production telemetry
     does. A gate that crashes, exits outside {0, 2}, times out, writes
     outside out/, or FAILS OPEN (logs its own ALLOW(internal-error),
     ALLOW(parse-error) and the like, then exits 0) fails CI.
  4. TEETH. Every synthetic scenario record must reach the verdict it
     `expect`s, and every replayed wiring must reach some verdict other than
     allow, or say why it never can (`allow_only`). Neither is satisfied by
     re-blessing the snapshot, so a gate that silently stops denying fails.
  5. HELPER EVIDENCE. Every Python module the gate processes execute is
     recorded by an audit hook. Each helper in hooks/ must be executed by some replayed
     gate, and the set of lib/*.py files executed must equal the manifest's
     lib_helpers list exactly.
  6. SNAPSHOT. The verdicts (one TSV row per non-allow verdict, plus a counts
     row per gate and event) must equal
     ops/fixtures/real-replay/verdict-snapshot.tsv. A change in any
     verdict fails CI until the snapshot is regenerated in the same pull
     request, so the reviewer reads the behaviour change as a diff.

DETERMINISM. The snapshot must be identical on a fresh Linux runner and on a
developer Mac with years of local state, so each worker replays inside its own
sandbox copy of the TRACKED tree only, untracked files never copied (with its
own single-commit git repository, never under a temp-directory prefix the gates
treat specially, which is refused outright, file times set
to the pinned instant), and every invocation gets a fresh HOME, TMPDIR and
out/. ops/gate_replay_shim/sitecustomize.py pins the clock, refuses sockets,
and records executed modules. A PATH shim turns network tools into failures.
Reason text is normalised (sandbox paths, digits, hex, UUIDs) before it is
compared.

USAGE:
    python3 ops/gate-replay.py            # CI: scan, check, replay, compare
    python3 ops/gate-replay.py --update   # rewrite the snapshot after a
                                          # deliberate verdict change
    python3 ops/gate-replay.py --jobs 8   # more workers (default: CPU count, max 8)
