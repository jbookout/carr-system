"""ops/restore-rehearse-record-selftest.py — the acceptance test for
bin/restore-rehearse.sh's evidence recording (Program 4).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Doctrine's exit bar for the weekly restore drill is
"recurring isolated restore from actual artifact, timed, integrity checked,
application verified, and RECORDED." Until now the script proved restorability
into a throwaway Neon branch and printed PASS/FAIL — and that PASS/FAIL died
with the terminal the moment the scheduled task's session ended. Nothing made
it durable. ops/config/services.json already carried a restore-rehearse-weekly
row and it read "last seen never" — registered, never observed.

WHAT record_rehearsal() DOES, restated here because this suite exists to prove
it: called from bin/restore-rehearse.sh's own EXIT trap (cleanup(), which runs
on every exit path — a die() in preflight, a failed branch or restore, a failed
verification, or the ordinary PASS/FAIL at the bottom), it writes ONE ops.run
row through tools/ops-record.py — service restore-rehearse-weekly, key
restore.rehearsal, state succeeded/failed, a failure_class bucket chosen from
two checkpoints the script already passes through (never from the exit code,
which is always a bare 1 here), and a --detail line carrying the dump's own
date/size and the measured decrypt+restore+verify duration — so the row answers
"how long does restore take and from which artifact" without archaeology.
--preflight and --verify-only both return before anything is created and must
record NOTHING, because neither one rehearses anything.

NO MOCK, SAME DISCIPLINE AS ops/run-scheduled-selftest.py. This suite drives
the REAL bin/restore-rehearse.sh as a real subprocess and reads its REAL
stdout/stderr — never a stand-in script, never a monkeypatched ops-record.py.
What it cannot afford is a real Neon branch and a real production read on every
push, so the script carries ONE test-only hook,
CARR_RESTORE_REHEARSE_SELFTEST=1 (never set by a scheduled task, launchd, or a
real "Run Now"), which short-circuits AFTER argument parsing and RECORD_
REHEARSAL's decision but BEFORE phase 0 touches anything — fixture env vars
then stand in for a dump having been selected, production's baseline having
been read, and phase 4's verification having produced a summary, and the
script's OWN cleanup()/record_rehearsal()/parse_rehearse_summary() run for
real from there. This is the same shape as bin/refresh-rules.sh's
CARR_REFRESH_RULES_EXPORT_CMD hook: the expensive, network/DB-touching middle
is substituted; the code under test is not.

THE PROVENANCE LINE IS THE TESTED SURFACE. record_rehearsal() prints
  evidence: state=... exit_code=... [failure_class=...] started_at=...
            detail: ...
BEFORE it ever attempts the database write — independent of whether the write
lands — precisely so this suite (and a human reading a scheduled task's
transcript) can see exactly what was derived from a fixture without needing a
reachable database. This suite asserts against THAT line, the same way
ops/run-scheduled-selftest.py asserts against out/run-scheduled.log's line.

TIER 1 (always runs; no DB, no credential; a fixture CARR_DB_JOBS_URL is
deliberately unreachable so the recorder's own write always fails LOUD on stderr, proving
that failure never touches the rehearsal's own exit code). Covers: the three
failure_class buckets, the detail line's shape (dump, bytes, date, pct,
tables, rows, duration), state=succeeded on exit 0, --preflight and
--verify-only recording nothing even when the fixture would otherwise produce
a full row, and the exit code passing through untouched in every case.

TIER 2 (a genuine restore rehearsal, run only when explicitly requested) is
deliberately NOT part of this file — it costs a real Neon branch and several
minutes, which is wrong for something CI runs on every push. That live proof
belongs to a human running `./run.sh restore-rehearse` once and reading the
row back with `tools/ops-record.py trace <correlation>`.
