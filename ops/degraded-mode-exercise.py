"""degraded-mode-exercise.py — cut the record layer off and check that nothing
lies.

PROGRAM 4'S RECOVERY HALF asks for "outage/degraded-mode exercises". This is
that exercise for the outage the system is most exposed to: the record layer
unreachable. Neon is a hosted database behind a network, the credential lives in
one file on one Mac, and every observability surface built this year reads from
it. An outage there is not exotic — it is a laptop on hotel wifi.

THE ONE PROPERTY UNDER TEST: WHEN THE LEDGER CANNOT BE READ, NOTHING REPORTS
ALL-CLEAR. Degrading is fine. Refusing is fine. Falling back to a lesser source
is fine when the fallback says so. The single unacceptable outcome is a surface
that prints something reassuring on the strength of data it never got, because
that is worse than the outage: the outage stops when the network comes back, and
a false green stops when somebody eventually notices.

That failure mode has a track record here rather than being hypothetical. The
`smoke` freshness row read green for days while nothing wrote its heartbeat. The
schedule-drift row read a trimmed log and reported a six-hour drift that never
happened, twice, on two different days. Both were surfaces answering confidently
from something they had not actually read.

HOW THE OUTAGE IS SIMULATED. Every component is run with its database
environment pointed at 127.0.0.1 port 1 — a port that refuses instantly rather
than hanging, so the whole exercise finishes in seconds instead of accumulating
connect timeouts. This is a REAL connection attempt to a REAL closed socket, not
a mock: the components take exactly the code path they take on a Mac whose
credential has not loaded or whose network is gone.

WHAT THIS EXERCISE DOES NOT COVER, said plainly rather than left implied:
  * a database that ACCEPTS connections and then answers slowly or wrongly —
    a refused connection is the easy outage, and a degraded-but-answering one
    is harder and is not simulated here;
  * the Cloudflare Worker, which has its own credential path and is not run by
    this exercise;
  * bin/nightly.sh's own ledger-off handling, which is real (it sets LEDGER_OFF
    and says so once) but cannot be exercised without running a whole nightly
    chain against production.

Exit 0 when every component degraded honestly, 1 when any of them lied.
