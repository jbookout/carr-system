"""rule-delivery-eval-selftest.py -- acceptance test for the rule-delivery
evaluation harness (ops/rule_delivery_eval.py, CLI ops/rule-delivery-eval.py).

Written before the harness, and it is the harness's only proof that its
numbers mean what they say. Everything here is offline: no Jev request, no
record-layer call, no write outside a throwaway directory.

WHAT IS PROVEN:
  1. The scorer's arithmetic, on hand-counted cases: true/false positives and
     misses, precision, recall, F1, the per-stratum split, and that a gold rule
     OUTSIDE a path's responsibility universe is never charged to that path as
     a miss (a layer-zero rule is loaded at boot, not by the prompt path).
  2. Disputed labels are excluded from both sides of the count.
  3. Notification cases are scored apart from the pooled human numbers (their
     own delivered-on-empty and false-positive counts), so noise on machine
     turns cannot hide inside a human precision figure.
  4. Pack-level scoring for the pack-granular drift observer.
  5. A PLANTED MIS-SCORED CASE: an expectation block whose numbers are wrong
     on purpose must be reported as a mismatch by check_expectations(), and a
     deliberately broken scorer (false positives and misses swapped) must fail
     the correct expectations. A checker that passes both would be vacuous.
  6. The real deterministic adapters (compiled prompt triggers, JIT PreToolUse
     rows, the drift observer, boot layer zero) run on the committed fixture
     against this checkout's real config and return only known rule ids.
  7. The Jev-backed adapters (the UserPromptSubmit judgment in
     ops/rule_trigger_delivery.py and the legacy ops/jev_rule_select.py) run
     end to end against a FAKE client: the rule the fake says binds is
     delivered, every request carries the harness's calls-log sink, and no
     production log, cache or audit file in this checkout's out/ is created or
     modified (the dry-run guarantee).
  8. The committed fixture is small, synthetic and clean: about fifteen cases,
     every gold id is a known rule, and no email address, phone number or
     dollar figure appears in it.
  9. The CLI runs on the fixture with Jev off and writes a JSON and Markdown
     report to the directory it was given.
