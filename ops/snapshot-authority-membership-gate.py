"""A database rebuilt from db/schema.sql must carry 0273's role membership.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (open loop #506 finding 3, 2026-08-22). The snapshot's
claim is that db/schema.sql plus the pending migrations fully describe the
applied database. Migration 0273 grants the carr_authority privilege bundle to
the externally provisioned human login roles. The day a snapshot refresh carried
the ledger past 0273, that grant stopped replaying anywhere — and nothing in the
snapshot carried it, because the CARR GRANTS section admits only app roles and
neondb_owner as members and neither login role is either. So the ledger said
0273 applied while the file it vouches for described a database where it never
had. A rebuild where carr_authority_joe exists came up with the bundle holding
its grants and NOBODY holding the bundle, which fails the authority privilege
contract — and the migration runner will never re-apply 0273, because its ledger
row is already there.

It was found by an independent review seat, called the sharpest open finding by
a second session, and walked past by two more. It was never reproduced against a
database until this gate, which is the actual reason it survived: every check
that could have caught it was reading a file.

WHAT THIS PROVES, against real Postgres, both ways round — because a guard is
only correct if BOTH of its branches are:

  1. ABSENT. With the login role absent, loading the preamble succeeds, grants
     nothing, and says so. This is the ordinary case: CI, a disposable local
     cluster, and any rebuild on a machine that has no authority credential.
     If this branch raised, the guard would abort every rebuild everywhere.
  2. PRESENT. With the login role present, loading the preamble grants it the
     bundle. This is the branch that carries 0273, and the one that was missing.
  3. THE GUARD IS LOAD-BEARING, not decoration: the unguarded statement the
     snapshot would otherwise have to emit raises undefined_object against an
     absent role, which is why this is rendered as a guarded block at all.
  4. JOINED, NEVER CREATED. Loading the preamble must not bring the login role
     into existence. These are human authority credentials provisioned outside
     this repository; a snapshot that minted a local carr_authority_joe would
     manufacture a principal that authenticates as Joe's authority on every
     machine that rebuilds.

SAFETY OF THE TEST ITSELF. The role this gate creates for branch 2 is made
NOLOGIN and with no password — the guard tests existence in pg_roles and nothing
else, so proving the branch never requires minting something that can
authenticate. Every statement runs inside one transaction that is always rolled
back, so the gate leaves no role, no membership, and no row behind.
