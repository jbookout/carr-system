"""rule-triage-selftest.py — acceptance test for WR-000019 slice S7's triage
artifact, ops/config/rule-triage.v1.json, plus a smoke test of the two tools
that read it (rule-triage-report.py, rule-triage-apply.py).

WHAT THIS PINS, per the slice's own definition of done:
  1. 211/211 coverage — every id in ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json's
     rule_controls (the full active-rule set) appears exactly once in the
     triage, and the triage names no id the enforcement map does not know.
  2. No rule sits in two homes (trivially true from dict construction, but
     pinned here so a future hand-edit of the JSON cannot reintroduce it).
  3. core count <= 35 (the slice's hard cap) and a warning line (not a
     failure) if it drifts from the 15-20 target band.
  4. Every GATE rule names a carrying_control, and that control is a real key
     in the enforcement map's control_catalog — never an invented name.
  5. Every GONE rule names a merge_target that (a) exists among the 211 ids
     and (b) is not itself GONE — a merge chain into a retired rule would be
     a dangling reference the moment Joe's batch actually retires anything.
  6. Every JIT rule carries a jit_trigger_hint (non-empty).
  7. rule-triage-report.py runs clean on the real artifact (smoke test).
  8. rule-triage-apply.py runs clean, is dry-run only (asserts no subprocess/
     network usage got introduced, and --json's "executed" field is false),
     and its retire-rule batch size matches the triage's GONE count exactly.

RUNNING IT. No database, no network:
