"""Fail a build bundle that cites evidence it never opened.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-02 all three A03 r2 capability-map builds failed
independent review on ONE shape: rationales citing artifacts the build's own
trace shows it never opened. One build opened 2 of 11 required prior-revision
artifacts; another never opened 8 of 12 and listed two sibling findings files
without reading them; a third attached the same basis to 35 rows, each naming
capture files it had only listed the directory of. All three self-audits
reported that check green, because each checked for expected PHRASES in a
basis string rather than whether the cited file was ever read.

Three independent builds, one shape, three green self-audits: that is a design
problem, not three lapses (rule 1c21263c). A check is better than a rule
because it fires without anyone remembering. Defect 0b07e57f-56cf-4cf9-a483-
72663dfb651f.

WHAT IT DOES. Extracts every evidence path cited in a bundle's artifacts,
extracts every path the trace shows the build actually opening, and fails on
the difference.

    ops/citation-trace-check.py <bundle-dir> <trace.jsonl>

Exit 0 when every cited evidence path was opened, 1 when any was not, 2 on a
usage or input error.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated because a check whose limits are unknown gets
trusted past them. It matches LITERAL paths under the evidence root. It does
not see a prose claim ("the r1 graph and the prose were read"), a citation
written as a bare filename rather than a path, or a glob. Run against the
three bundles that failed review on 2026-09-02 it catches two of the citation
failures the reviewers found and misses the prose-shaped ones. It is a FLOOR,
not a substitute for reading the trace — the trace is still the verification
surface, and this only makes the cheapest slice of that reading automatic.
