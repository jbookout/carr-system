"""frozen-install-check-selftest.py — the seeded unfrozen install is caught.

This is the acceptance test named by slice R05: "the checker catches a seeded
unfrozen install locally". It seeds real violations into a throwaway tree and
asserts ops/frozen-install-check.py fails on each one — and, just as important,
that it does NOT fail on the near-misses that would make it noise: a quoted
error message telling a human to run npm install, a comment explaining why an
install is not run, a Python hint string, a global CLI install, and the
installer bootstrap.

A checker that only proves the positive case is a checker nobody trusts once it
starts firing, so every negative below is a shape that actually exists in this
repo's tree today.

Run: .venv/bin/python ops/frozen-install-check-selftest.py   # exit 0 = all pass
