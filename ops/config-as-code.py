"""config-as-code.py — the machine config belongs in the repo, same as the code.

WHY (Joe, 2026-08-03: "shouldnt all code be in the repo? .json is code").

He is right, and the exposure was worse than the one file he was pointing at.
Measured that night:

    ~/.claude/settings.json      1 on disk,  0 in the repo   <- fires all 5 hooks
    launchd plists               2 on disk,  0 in the repo   <- incl. the hourly
                                                                rule refresh
    scheduled tasks             15 on disk,  4 in the repo

So the five hook SCRIPTS were version-controlled and the thing that makes them
run was not. That is the two-homes disease the whole system is built to avoid:
the same night, hooks/SETTINGS-BLOCK.md was found to have silently drifted — it
documented two hooks and the live file had four. A document DESCRIBING config
drifts. Config in the repo does not.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and the reason is not squeamishness. It does not put
`~/.claude/settings.json` in the repo wholesale. That file also carries 77
permission entries and notification prefs that are Joe's, machine-shaped, and
churn weekly — committing them would create a second home for something Claude
Code only ever reads from ~/.claude/, and a baseline would go stale exactly the
way SETTINGS-BLOCK.md did. Only the CARR-OWNED `hooks` block is tracked, and
`install` merges it back leaving every other key untouched.

THE PATTERN IS THE ONE THE SYSTEM ALREADY USES: source in the repo, render on
the machine. settings.json becomes a render, the same way clients-active.md is.

PORTABILITY IS THE POINT, NOT A BONUS. Repo copies store {{HOME}}, {{REPO}} and
{{VAULT}} instead of /Users/booko. That is what lets the same source install on
Dell's machine — and 54 of the 70 active rules are SHARED scope, binding him
exactly as they bind Joe, with zero mechanical enforcement on his side today.

    ops/config-as-code.py check      # drift report; exit 1 if any. THE DEFAULT.
    ops/config-as-code.py pull       # machine -> repo (capture what is live)
    ops/config-as-code.py install    # repo -> machine (deploy; needs --apply)
    ops/config-as-code.py reinstall-launchd-calendar [--apply] [--kickstart]
    ops/config-as-code.py install-codex-continuity --apply
    ops/config-as-code.py verify-codex-continuity
    ops/config-as-code.py install-codex-continuity-mcp --apply
    ops/config-as-code.py verify-codex-continuity-mcp
    ops/config-as-code.py install-progress-board [--repo CANONICAL] --apply
    ops/config-as-code.py verify-progress-board [--repo CANONICAL]
    ops/config-as-code.py check-launchd-main-paths
    ops/config-as-code.py remove-codex-continuity --apply

`check` is what belongs in run.sh health: it answers "is the live config still
the config we think we have", which is the question nobody could answer tonight.

    WHY THIS IS NOT just `here` (fixed 2026-08-13). {{REPO}} tokenizes paths
    inside the MACHINE's installed config — launchd plists, settings.json — and
    the machine has exactly ONE installation, which always points at the main
    checkout. Deriving the token from this file's own location meant that running
    from a linked worktree tokenized to the WORKTREE path, so every live item
    referencing the real checkout compared unequal. Measured the same day: the
    identical command reported `OK — 36 items, repo matches machine` in the main
    checkout and `DRIFT — 18 of 36 items` from a worktree, on an unchanged
    machine. Nothing had drifted.

    That false positive was not cosmetic. It failed the config-as-code class in
    pre-push CI, which blocked pushing from a worktree — and working from a
    worktree is the standing remedy when the shared tree is busy, so the check
    broke the escape hatch. Worse, its stated remedy is `config-as-code.py pull`,
    which would have captured the machine's absolute paths INTO the repo,
    destroying the {{REPO}} templating that exists so Dell's clone works at a
    different path. Following the advice would have made the repo unportable.

    git's own answer is authoritative and cheap: --git-common-dir resolves to the
    MAIN repository's .git from inside any linked worktree (a worktree's own
    --git-dir points into .git/worktrees/<name>). Falls back to `here` when git

# `git -C <path>` IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF WHICH REPOSITORY YOU HIT. Every variable
# below outranks both -C and the working directory, and git exports several of
# them to every hook it runs — so anything reached from a hook inherits them.
# That is the 2026-08-14 incident: a selftest whose fixture used cwd=mkdtemp()
# ran its git commands against the live checkout instead, rewrote local main
# onto its own seed commits, and marked the repository core.bare true.
#
# THIS FILE WAS ASSESSED AS READ-ONLY AND THAT WAS WRONG. It used to run
# `git -C REPO config core.hooksPath ops/githooks`, which is a WRITE: under an
# inherited GIT_DIR it lands in whatever repository the variable names, not in
# REPO, so `config-as-code.py install` invoked from a hook could point a
# different repository's hooksPath at this repo's ops/githooks. That write is
# GONE — core.hooksPath is no-touch now — which removes the worst case but not
# the reason for this scrubber: the remaining git calls are reads, and
# misdirected they yield a wrong drift verdict, which is a lie in a checker
# whose entire job is detecting drift.
#
# GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is the subtle one and is why this list is not just GIT_DIR:
# its KEY_<n>/VALUE_<n> pairs can set core.worktree and relocate a call with

# Claude scheduled-task definitions are not merely configuration files: their
# presence asks a local AI client to perform work later.  Every tracked task is
# therefore primary-only until its *own* machine scope has been reviewed and
# deliberately listed here.  The empty allow-list is intentional.  It keeps a
# Dell migration from turning Joe's existing task catalogue into Dell's queue,
# while still leaving a narrow, auditable path for a future Dell-specific task.
#
# This policy is fail-closed in both directions:
#   * a tracked primary task missing from a secondary machine is not drift;
#   * a CARR-managed task found on a secondary machine is visible drift and is
#     never pulled into the shared baseline; unrelated personal tasks are not
#     CARR configuration and this tool never claims, moves, or counts them; and
#   * secondary install never creates ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks; primary install
#     renders the tracked definitions it owns.
# The actual scheduler registration is outside this config reconciler, so
# copying a SKILL.md would be both insufficient and unsafe.
#
# STILL EMPTY, deliberately, and here is the near-miss that tried to change it.
# On 2026-08-18 source-of-truth copies of Dell's three personal tasks were added
# to ops/scheduled-tasks/, which made them CARR-owned by this file's own rule —
# "the repository is the ownership registry" — and dell-social-batch-weekly
# immediately reported as a secondary scope violation. The first fix was to list
# the three here. That was the wrong lever: it widens the machine-scope policy to
# paper over a filing mistake, and it also left ops/control-plane-selftest.py
# failing, because that selftest requires every *.SKILL.md directly under
# ops/scheduled-tasks/ to be a registered control-plane workflow, which personal
# tasks are not and should not be.
#
# The copies now live in ops/scheduled-tasks/dell/. Both this reconciler and the
# control-plane selftest read only the top level, so the subdirectory keeps the
# repo copies Dell asked for while leaving his tasks classified as what they are:
# personal configuration this tool does not claim, move, or count. Anything added
# to the TOP level is a CARR-managed primary task and must be registered as a
# control-plane workflow.

    only caller is git_hooks_path_report, which prints what is observed so a
    human can decide; a future caller that uses this answer to write the setting
    would reintroduce exactly the hazard the no-touch contract exists for.

    Install used to write the relative "ops/githooks" unconditionally, which
    turned the ABSOLUTE canonical path — the designed state, as
    ops/prepush-floor-selftest.py says in as many words ("always canonical's —
    core.hooksPath is one shared path for every worktree") — into a value git

    them, as a side effect of a job about plists. Found and undone by hand
    during the 2026-09-12 Gate Zero activation.

    The test is RESOLUTION, not string equality, so two shapes count as pointing
    at these hooks:

      * the literal relative default, which git resolves per worktree but which
        names this repository's own hooks directory in a canonical checkout;
      * an absolute path whose realpath is this repo's ops/githooks.

    A relative value that is NOT the default is non-conformant: git resolves it
    per worktree, so it names no single directory this function could honestly
    compare. Unset is non-conformant too — that is the fresh-machine case, and

    # request review team-loops T39 relied on has no server-side replacement.
    # ops/githooks/pre-push refuses a direct push to main from any identity but
    # the owner's. The hooks ship with the code and this block makes them
    # executable. That is ALL it does.
    #
    # core.hooksPath IS NO-TOUCH, UNCONDITIONALLY. Install does not set it, does
    # not reconcile it, and does not read it in order to decide whether to write
    # it — not when it is unset, not when it is relative, not when it is
    # absolute, not when it names another repository's hooks. ONE .git/config
    # holds that value for every worktree on this machine, so any write here
    # changes which pre-push runs in all of them as a side effect of a job about
    # plists: an apply run for two launch agents re-pointed ~50 worktrees away
    # from the canonical hooks ops/prepush-floor-selftest.py relies on, and the
    # absolute canonical path had to be restored by hand during the 2026-09-12
    # Gate Zero activation. A conditional write is the same hazard with a
    # narrower trigger, so there is no condition under which this code writes.
    #
    # WHICH LEAVES THE FRESH-MACHINE CASE TO A HUMAN, deliberately. Whether hook
    # resolution is enabled at all is REPORTED by `config-as-code.py check`
    # (git_hooks_path_report below) as an observation that never changes the
    # value and never changes the exit code. Setting it on a new clone is one
    # documented command a person runs once, which is a smaller cost than an

# booting out the job that started it, and then reloads that job. It uses a
# throwaway label (com.carr.handoff-smoke-<random>) whose plist lives in its own
# directory under the hand-off dir, never in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and it
# touches no other label. Version 1 of the plist runs this file's
# `launchd-handoff-smoke-job`, which hands its own reload off exactly as
# fleet-sync does and then sleeps; version 2 runs /bin/sleep. The smoke boots
# the label out while the job is running (killing the job's process group), then
# waits for the one-shot to load version 2. It always cleans up: bootout of the
# throwaway label, then unlink of every file it created. Without --run it only
