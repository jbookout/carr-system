program3-trace-gate.py — THE ACCEPTANCE TEST FOR PROGRAM 3, written before the
thing it tests (rule e65efc68).

THE GATE, in the roadmap's own words: "one traceable view explains a failed
critical journey without terminal archaeology."

That sentence is not directly executable, so this file is the executable form of
it, and it is deliberately the FIRST artifact of Program 3. Everything the
migration builds exists to make these five assertions pass. If a later change
makes any of them pass for the wrong reason, the assertion is wrong and gets
fixed here — never loosened to match the code.

WHAT "WITHOUT TERMINAL ARCHAEOLOGY" MEANS, MECHANICALLY. Today the answer to
"why did last night's chain fail" lives in out/nightly.log, a text file on one
Mac, readable only by a human with a shell on that Mac, holding no environment,
no correlation to the deploy that preceded it, and no link to the incident it
caused. The gate is met when ONE query, against the record layer, returns that
whole chain. So assertion 1 is literally: one query, one correlation id, every
link in the journey.

THE FIVE ASSERTIONS.

  1. ONE QUERY RETURNS THE WHOLE CHAIN. A single select on ops.v_trace, keyed by
     one correlation id, returns every link of a failed journey — the deployment
     that preceded it, the synthetic golden-workflow check that caught it, the
     job run that failed, and the incident raised from it — in time order.

  2. EVERY ROW NAMES ITS SOURCE AND ITS FRESHNESS. Not one row in that chain may
     report a state without also reporting where the state came from and how old
     it is. A number with no provenance is the thing this program exists to
     replace.

  3. A FAILURE NAMES ITS CLASS. A run that failed and cannot say what class of
     failure it was is not an observation, it is a shrug. The database refuses
     it.

  4. A SILENT COLLECTOR READS UNKNOWN, NEVER LAST-GREEN. This is the premortem's
     second-most-likely catastrophe in the Control Room BDUF ("false health from
     stale collectors") and the risk register's named proof: "Collector-off
     fixture renders Unknown and alert". A service whose last observation has
     aged past its cadence must read unknown/stale — the previous success must
     NOT survive as current health.

  5. THE READ ROLE CANNOT WRITE. Program 3's Control Room foundation is
     READ-ONLY by phase rule ("no mutation routes exist"). The database half of
     that is least privilege: carr_reader may select and may not insert.

WHERE IT RUNS. Against any database whose DSN is in DATABASE_URL. Intended
target is the isolated staging project:

    .venv/bin/python tools/db-tap.py --project staging run ops/program3-trace-gate.py

EVERY ROW IT WRITES IS ROLLED BACK. The test seeds a complete failed journey and
then aborts the transaction, so it can run against a live database as often as
you like without leaving residue. Nothing here is a fixture file that can drift
from the schema; the seed IS the schema's contract, exercised.
