"""hook-telemetry-rollup-selftest.py — acceptance test for ops/hook-telemetry-rollup.py.

THE CHECK THAT MATTERS MOST is the one about what the rollup must NOT say. Its
retire-candidate rule can end with a gate being deleted, so a false positive
here is a control removed on the strength of a number. The council's rule has
three clauses — zero live denies in 7 days, catch-class owned by pre-commit or
ops/ci.sh, and on the hot path — and cases 3 through 6 below take a gate that
satisfies two of the three and require that it is NOT reported. In particular a
gate whose owner is still "unverified" is never a candidate, because unverified
means nobody has checked, not that nobody is watching.

The rest is arithmetic with a purpose: percentiles computed by nearest rank so a
handful of firings does not silently become a p95 of nothing; live-only reading,
so fixture traffic can never re-enter the number; reopens attributed per gate
per day, because a reopen spends tokens and the question is which gate spends
them; and a torn last line — which a log being appended to by 13 concurrent
processes will eventually have — skipped rather than fatal.

The rollup is driven as a subprocess against a fixture repo, because it resolves
its paths at import.
