"""jev_deal_read.py -- read what the record actually says about a live deal.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO ANSWER. Joe asked for deal close
likelihood. Before writing a line of it this module's author measured what the
record layer holds per live deal, and the measurement changed the build:

    live deals ................................................. 74
    free-text evidence under 200 characters .................... 67
    free-text evidence over 200 characters ...................... 7
    deals carrying a document set ............................... 1
    deals carrying key dates .................................... 1
    closed deals over the same floor ............................ 2 of 99

A likelihood for the 67 would be the model reading a client's name and a phase
label and inventing the rest, and it would look exactly as confident as the
seven real ones. So this module GATES ON EVIDENCE: a deal under the floor is
reported as unanswerable and no question is asked about it. The thin book is
the finding, not a thing to paper over.

AND IT CANNOT BE VALIDATED AGAINST OUTCOMES. There are 99 closed deals carrying
a real won or lost result, which is exactly the held-out slice this work owes.
Two of them clear the same floor, and BOTH WERE WON -- there is not one losing
deal on record with enough written down to learn a loss from. Six carry any free
text at all. The rest hold a name, a type and a lane, so the only honest thing
derivable from them is a base rate per deal type, which is arithmetic and
belongs in SQL. No number this module returns has been checked against a known
outcome, and none may be described as predictive until it has.

A COUNT THAT LOOKED LIKE EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT: the first pass here said six
closed deals carried evidence, because the length of an EMPTY legacy activity
array -- the two characters of "[]" -- was being summed into every row. Six was
the count of rows with any free text; the count that matters is two.

IT IS A LIBRARY AND MUST STAY ONE. No shebang, no main guard -- either makes a
.py file a registered script entrypoint in the sealed source inventory, moves
the frontier and owes a forward-only registry successor. The detector is a
regex over the whole file and does not know what a docstring is, so the
construct is described and never spelled. Callers are entrypoints that already
exist; generators/build-deal-room.py is the one this ships wired to.

THE THREE QUESTIONS, one of each shape, asked in ONE request because they are
independent judgments over the same state:

  movement       Score  -- how far the recorded evidence shows the transaction
                          has moved toward a signature, on five rungs that each
                          describe a concrete recorded situation.
  waiting_on     Choice -- who or what the next step is waiting on, with an
                          explicit option for "the record does not say".
  silence_is_bad Noul   -- whether the measured days of silence are a sign of
                          trouble GIVEN what the deal was waiting on.

The Noul is deliberately not "has this deal been quiet". Quiet is a date
subtraction and code does it below, exactly and for free; asking a model to
detect a condition code already knows duplicates the deterministic pass and
teaches nothing. What code cannot do is rule on whether a particular silence
MATTERS, and that is the question asked.

DEGRADING IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. No credential, no network, a refused
request: read_deals returns bundles with `judged=False` and a reason, and the
Deal Room renders exactly as it did before this module existed.
