# verb-count.sh — print the number of verbs the MCP registry would ship.
#
# WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. This count is the artifact-mismatch guard: it is what
# caught loop #276, where a stale-branch deploy silently dropped 9 verbs from
# production. Until now it lived as a three-line inline snippet inside
# bin/deploy-worker.sh, which meant it only ran at DEPLOY time — after review,
# after merge, at the moment of shipping. Program 2 needs the same guard to run
# at MERGE time, and rule a8c55a47 is explicit that a manual path and an
# automated path doing the same job must be the same code, not two copies that
# drift. So the snippet moved here and both callers import it.
#
# THE COUNT IS EXACT, NOT PARSED, and that property is load-bearing. It imports
# the module and reads Object.keys(TOOLS).length. A regex over the source
# undercounts — 61 against a real 66 on the branch that caused loop #276 — and a
# guard that reports the wrong number is worse than no guard, because it reports
# it confidently.
#
# Usage:  ops/verb-count.sh <worker-dir>      # prints an integer on stdout
# Exits non-zero, printing nothing to stdout, when the registry will not import.
# A refusal to count is never the same as a count of zero: the caller must treat
# a non-zero exit as "unmeasured", not as "shrank to nothing".

# The deploy wrapper may count a typed-recovery candidate from a clean,
# detached historical worktree.  Those worktrees deliberately have no ignored
# node_modules input, so resolving bare ESM imports from WORKER_DIR would fail
# even though the current wrapper checkout has the verified dependency tree
# that Wrangler will use.  Import through a temporary symlink topology instead:
# the historical worker remains the exact source, while Node resolves packages
# from this checkout's dependency runtime.  --preserve-symlinks is essential;
# without it Node follows the worker symlink back into the detached worktree
# before resolving packages.  Nothing is written into the exact source root.
