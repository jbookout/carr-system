main-commit-gate-selftest.py — the acceptance test for ops/githooks/pre-commit,
written before the hook itself (rule e65efc68).

WHAT THE HOOK IS FOR. `main` in this repo moves only through a merged pull
request with green CI — that is what the branch ruleset enforces on the server.
Nothing enforced the LOCAL half, so a commit could still land on `main` in
~/carr-system, the checkout several sessions share and the one launchd runs. Its
push is then refused, the commit strands, and the tree diverges. That is not a
hypothetical: on 2026-08-14 that tree held nine commits existing on no other
machine, and out/rules-refresh.log carries the mechanism verbatim —
"FAIL push refused, commit is local only — carr-system CI — 70fd470 on main".

So the hook refuses a commit whose branch is `main`, and points at
bin/worktree.sh, which already exists for exactly this and which the git writer
gate's own deny text already recommends.

WHAT IT MUST NOT DO, which is most of why this file exists:

  1. IT MUST NOT BREAK A COMMIT ON ANY OTHER BRANCH. Every worktree on this
     machine is on its own branch and every one of them commits constantly. A
     gate that catches those is worse than no gate.

  2. IT MUST NOT BREAK A DETACHED HEAD. Bisects, `git worktree add` at a bare
     sha, and CI checkouts all run detached. A detached HEAD is not `main` and
     the hook must not guess that it is.

  3. IT MUST HAVE AN ESCAPE HATCH THAT WORKS. Reconciling the shared checkout
     legitimately needs a commit on main, and a gate with no documented way
     through gets disabled wholesale the first time it blocks someone at 2am.
     Same idiom and spelling shape as pre-push's CARR_ALLOW_MAIN_PUSH.

  4. IT MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE REPOSITORY IT IS INSTALLED IN. git exports GIT_DIR
     to every hook, and ops/git_env.py exists because a check that trusts an
     inherited GIT_DIR operates on whatever repository invoked it. Every case
     below runs against a throwaway fixture repo, and one case asserts the outer
     repository gained no commits — the same leak ops/git-env-selftest.py guards.

RUNNING IT. No database, no network, no production access:

    .venv/bin/python ops/main-commit-gate-selftest.py

ops/ci.sh already globs ops/*-selftest.py, so this is enforced from the commit
that adds it, with no CI change.
