"""gate-lifecycle-report-selftest.py — acceptance test for
ops/gate-lifecycle-report.py (WR-000019 slice S5).

Drives the report as a subprocess against synthetic fixture repos (its own
CARR_LIFECYCLE_REPO env var, same convention as ops/hook-telemetry-rollup.py's
CARR_ROLLUP_REPO), so it never touches this machine's real out/ or
ops/config/ files -- those are shared with every other worktree and session on
this Mac (out/ is a symlink back to the canonical checkout), and a test that
wrote real timestamps into them would be a flake waiting to collide with
whatever else is running.

THE THREE SCENARIOS THE SLICE ASKS FOR, PROVEN AGAINST SYNTHETIC LOGS:
  1. one quiet window on an ENFORCING gate       -> downgrade_to_announce
  2. two consecutive quiet windows                -> propose_retirement
     (checked for both an enforcing gate and an already-announce gate, since
     the rule fires "regardless of current mode" once the second window is
     quiet)
  3. an ACTIVE gate (a true positive in the current window) -> no proposal

Plus the coverage invariant (check:s5-lifecycle-fields-present): a gate wired
in ops/config/hooks.json with no entry in ops/config/gate-lifecycle.json must
fail the script's exit code, by name, every time -- and a gate that legitimately
lacks a timestamp in its own log (data_available: false) must never receive a
proposal even if every window it CAN see is empty, because "no data" and
"quiet" are different findings and conflating them is exactly the kind of
guess this codebase's other rollups (hook-telemetry-rollup.py's own
window_truncated_by_rotation) refuse to make silently.

Also proven: a shadow-mode gate never receives a downgrade/retirement proposal
regardless of how long it has been quiet (there is nothing to downgrade FROM),
and the report's own --no-append flag actually skips the
out/gate-lifecycle-report.jsonl write (so a caller who wants dry-run output
gets it).
