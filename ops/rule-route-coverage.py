"""ops/rule-route-coverage.py — every active rule has a delivery route that can fire.

# doctrine: rule-delivery-load-layers

WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe demands 100% recall from rule delivery. The design that
answers it (ops/config/rule-routes.v1.json, read by lib/rule_routes.py) gives
every active rule at least one route — boot, trigger, path_rule, gate, or its
surviving duplicate. A route file can rot in exactly the ways that look
finished and deliver nothing, so this check refuses them structurally:

  1. AN ACTIVE RULE WITH ZERO ROUTES, or a corpus rule the route file never
     mentions. Either is a rule no session is ever shown at its moment.
  2. A TRIGGER NAMING A VERB OR TOOL THAT DOES NOT EXIST — a verb the server
     does not serve (read from the generated registry that
     mcp-server/src/mutation-registry.js imports, which every verb in
     mcp-server/src/tools.js and the modules it spreads must appear in),
     a tool Claude Code does not have, or a tool the delivering hook
     (hooks/rule-pack-preuse-reselection.py) is never invoked for, because its
     PreToolUse matcher in ops/config/hooks.json does not admit it. Each is a
     trigger that can never fire.
  3. A STALE ID: a route-file entry for a rule that is not in the corpus.
  4. A CLASS-D RULE WITHOUT ITS GATE, a gate file that does not exist, or a
     class-d rule enforced only by a Stop hook with no trigger in front of it
     (the model must see the rule before acting, not only be blocked after) —
     unless the entry says in words why no tool call marks its moment.
  5. A CLASS-E DUPLICATE that does not name a surviving rule which itself has
     a non-duplicate route.
  6. A BASH PATTERN THAT IS NOT A REGULAR EXPRESSION, a trigger that names
     nothing, an unknown route kind, or rule text carried in the route file
     (it holds ids and matchers only).

Repository content only: no network, no database, no machine state. It runs
in ops/ci.sh's gates inventory loop.
