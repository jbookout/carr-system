"""Fixtures for hooks/stop_latch.py — the claim-set latch, written before it.

WHAT THIS HAS TO PROVE. The 2026-08-23 gates-audit council named one defect in
today's labeled gate ledger with both chairs agreeing on it: the
completion-evidence gate fired a SECOND time on a summary whose claims already
carried receipts one message earlier. Grok called it "no latch on claim-set";
Sol called it "receipt reuse and finding identity". The same chair's own sitting
tripped hooks/drift-assertion-gate.py twice for the same reason one layer down —
that gate keys its "speak once" memory on the EXACT prose, so a single changed
word ("regression") minted a new identity for an identical finding.

So the acceptance shape is four properties, and every one of them is a case
below:

  1. IDENTITY IS THE CLAIM-SET, NOT THE WORDS. The same claims in reworded
     prose, in a different order, in different case, produce ONE identity. This
     is the property the drift gate's text hash does not have.
  2. A DIFFERENT CLAIM-SET IS A DIFFERENT FINDING. Narrowing must not become
     muting: add a claim and the gate speaks again.
  3. RECEIPTS LATCH IT SHUT. Once a claim-set is recorded satisfied, a later
     restatement never fires — even a restatement that would qualify on its own.
     That is Joe's 2026-08-15 ruling in its Stop-gate form: remember what was
     already answered rather than widening the matcher.
  4. SESSIONS DO NOT CROSS WIRES. out/ is a symlink back to the canonical
     checkout from every worktree on this Mac, so a latch keyed on a shared
     name would let one session silence another's gate. Two sessions, two
     ledgers.

And the property that outranks all four: FAIL OPEN. A latch that cannot read or
write its state must let the gate SPEAK, never silence it. An unwritable
directory silencing every Stop gate on the machine is a far worse failure than
one duplicate fire, so the unwritable case is asserted explicitly.
