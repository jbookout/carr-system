"""conduct-gate-selftest.py — fixtures for hooks/conduct-stop-gate.py.

Spawns the REAL hook with a REAL transcript and reads its actual stdout, the
same way ops/guard-selftest.py exercises the egress guard. It does not import
and call scan(), because that would test a function rather than the thing
settings.json actually runs.

BOTH HALVES MATTER. MUST BLOCK is the conduct the gate exists to stop. MUST
ALLOW is ordinary work and the narrow exemptions — a gate that blocks
legitimate turns gets switched off within a week, which is the same outcome as
never building it.

The near-miss cases exist because widening PROTECTED to catch a money question
phrased as "$240" briefly let bare words like plan/rate/tier buy an exemption,
which silently unblocked real offloads.

REBUILT 2026-08-09 after a concurrent session deleted every uncommitted file in
this build. Committed immediately this time.
