"""ops/pr_actor.py — clears a stranded pull request with code, not a model.

WHY THIS IS CODE. Joe, 2026-08-15: "we are actively moving away from AI running
the system and more into code running the system", and before that, "rather than
another scheduled routine, i'd like to have a code script handle this". Both
restate the rule he taught at the 2026-08-13 architecture council: never spend a
model on state, recurrence, routing, validation or any decision already
expressible as a tested predicate, and write every workflow step whose correct
result can be finitely specified as deterministic code. A session proposed a
model-driven scheduled routine for this job anyway, which is the error that
produced this file.

WHAT IT PAIRS WITH. ops/pr-hygiene-check.py NOTICES a stranded pull request.
This one CLEARS it. Split on purpose: the noticing runs read-only in the nightly
health row, and only this half can write.

THE FOUR OUTCOMES, and there are only four:

  close-superseded  every commit is already in main by patch-id. The pull
                    request is finished and nobody noticed. PR #145 on
                    2026-08-14 was exactly this: its fix merged as #151 and the
                    original sat red, emailing Joe, for an hour.

  rebase            the branch is merely behind main and the rebase applies
                    clean. Push it and CI re-runs against current main.

  resolve-generated the ONLY conflicting paths are declared generated files —
                    written wholesale by tooling, so there is no human intent in
                    either copy to preserve. Take main's, continue, push. PR #79
                    on 2026-08-14 was exactly this: its sole conflict was
                    ops/config/gate-baseline.json, rewritten by an hourly job.

  report-only       anything else. A real source conflict, a red check, a draft,
                    or a conflict set that MIXES generated and source files. The
                    actor states what it found and stops.

WHY report-only IS THE DEFAULT AND NOT A FALLBACK. Every case above had to be
argued into existence. A red check is not auto-rebased because a red test may be
a real bug and rebasing it hides the signal under a fresh run. A mixed conflict
set is refused whole rather than partially resolved, because a partial mechanical
resolution is the most dangerous outcome here: it looks handled.

WHY MAIN'S COPY ALWAYS WINS A GENERATED-FILE CONFLICT. Generated files are
written wholesale, so a second writer does not get a merge conflict in the normal
sense — it silently replaces the first. Two pull requests did exactly that on
2026-08-14: one reverted a CI class to an older copy, and one restored a stale
gate hash over a fresh bless, leaving main shipping a gate whose recorded hash
did not match its own file until a human re-blessed it. Taking main's copy is the
only direction that cannot lose a newer write. The branch's own change to that
file is then reproduced by re-running its generator, which is the caller's job
and is why `regenerate` is part of the policy.

NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT --execute. The default is a plan on stdout.

RUN IT:
    python3 ops/pr_actor.py                 # plan only
    python3 ops/pr_actor.py --execute       # act
    python3 ops/pr_actor.py --json
