write-effect-check-selftest.py — acceptance test for hooks/write-effect-check.py,
written before the check (rule e65efc68).

WHY IT EXISTS, and it is the lesson of 2026-08-14 rather than a new idea. Every
write control here parses INTENT: record-home-gate reads a tool's file_path,
bash-write-gate extracts targets from a shell command. Intent-parsing cannot be
complete against arbitrary shell, and on the day bash-write-gate shipped it
produced TWO false refusals of legitimate work in one afternoon — an unexpanded
`$D` judged as literal text, and a path merely MENTIONED beside an unrelated
write. Both came from the gate answering a question it could not answer instead
of declining.

This asks a different question, and one that has an answer: not "what is this
command going to write" but "what actually changed". That is complete with
respect to HOW a write happened — heredoc, unknown interpreter, a script invoked
by name, a path built from variables at runtime, any of it. None of those can
hide from the filesystem.

WHAT IT WATCHES, and the scoping is what makes it quiet enough to live with.
Only vault markdown that the record-home policy says NOTHING may write: 564 of
the 620 files, against 44 generated renders and 12 machine-required exemptions.
Renders are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED — the exporter writes them several times a day,
often from launchd while a session's Bash command is mid-flight, and effects
alone cannot tell the exporter's write from a session's. Watching only files with
no legitimate writer means no allowlist is needed and the hourly refresh cannot
produce a single false report.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It cannot prevent — the write has already happened when the check
runs. It reports, and that is the honest ceiling of an effect-based control at
the hook layer. Prevention at this completeness needs the filesystem or the
record layer, which is a bigger build. Reporting is still worth having: the
failure this closes is the SILENT one, where a write lands somewhere no query
finds and nobody learns it happened.

DIRECTION OF ERROR, chosen deliberately after today: this is a detector, so its
worst failure is noise rather than blocked work. That is the right way round for
a first version, and the opposite of what bash-write-gate got wrong twice.

Tested in two halves plus an end-to-end, and the split is stated rather than
hidden: the SWEEP half runs against a throwaway directory, because a fixture
cannot be placed inside the real vault; the VERDICT half runs against the real
policy and real vault paths WITHOUT touching any file. Testing the sweep against
the real vault would make the suite depend on Drive being mounted, and testing
the verdict against a fixture would repeat exactly the mistake that made
bash-write-gate's first suite measure nothing.
