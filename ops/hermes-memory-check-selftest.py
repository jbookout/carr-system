"""hermes-memory-check-selftest.py — fixtures for ops/hermes-memory-check.py.

A check that has never been shown to FAIL is a check nobody should trust: it
would read green whether or not the thing it guards is intact. Each case below
is a memory file the runtime could plausibly write on its own, and the negative
cases are the point.
