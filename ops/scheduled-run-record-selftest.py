"""ops/scheduled-run-record-selftest.py — the acceptance test for the
Program 3 scheduled-task recording gap: "Job failure becomes a durable failed
run, incident, or Work Request. It cannot exist only in stdout or a local
log." (roadmap line, quoted verbatim), for the ~17 Claude Code scheduled
tasks specifically.

Same house style as ops/program3-trace-gate.py and ops/program3-incident-gate.py:
inline assertions, printed as ok/FAIL, isolated fixtures. Two tiers:

  TIER 1 (always runs, no DB, no credential). Pure-function checks against
  lib/scheduled_run.py using fabricated transcript fixtures written to temp
  files, plus subprocess checks of the REAL hook and the REAL CLI with a
  DELIBERATELY UNREACHABLE DATABASE_URL — so "tolerates a missing DB
  credential by failing loud but not corrupting the run" is proven without
  ever touching a real database, staging or production.

  TIER 2 (only when DATABASE_URL is already set in the environment — i.e. run
  through `tools/db-tap.py --project staging run ops/scheduled-run-record-
  selftest.py`, never bare). Registers a throwaway probe service, records one
  run through the real CLI, reads it back from ops.run, and DELETES it
  explicitly before exiting — psycopg autocommit is what ops-record.py's own
  connections use (see tools/ops-record.py connect()), so there is no
  transaction to roll back; explicit cleanup is the isolation instead.

  This tier never runs against production, and since 2026-08-18 that is CHECKED:
  tools/staging_jobs_dsn.py proves the DSN addresses the isolated staging
  endpoint before minting the ephemeral carr_jobs identity the recorder now
  requires, and the CLI subprocess runs with that credential and no broader one.
  The old wording — "it only activates when DATABASE_URL is present, and that is
  what db-tap --project staging sets" — described a convention, and PR #288 is
  what proved a convention was not enough.

    .venv/bin/python ops/scheduled-run-record-selftest.py                  # tier 1 only

    SETTING every name, from ops-record.py's own credential_names(), is the
