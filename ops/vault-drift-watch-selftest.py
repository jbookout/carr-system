"""vault-drift-watch-selftest.py — prove the drift watch actually detects drift.

WHY THIS SHELLS OUT rather than importing ops/vault-drift-watch.py and calling
its functions directly: the artifact that matters is the SCRIPT AS INVOKED —
stdout report plus exit code — because that is what the nightly chain and
tools/health-check.py actually consume. An in-process import test could pass
while a real invocation's exit code path was broken (argv parsing, sys.exit
plumbing, an exception swallowed somewhere on the way out); the F10 lesson this
build brief cites is exactly that a claimed exit-code contract needs a real
subprocess test, not an assumption from reading the source.

Runs entirely against scratch roots under /private/tmp — never the real vault,
and never the real repo's out/ directory: every run() call passes its own
--baseline-dir / --quarantine-dir / --salvage-manifest / --summary under the
same per-case scratch base as --root / --manifest, so a test case can never
read or write anything the real nightly chain or a developer's own
--rebaseline touches.

v2 additions over the original 10-case suite: --rebaseline, the registry
tamper check against a rebaselined snapshot, the heal cycle (tamper ->
rebaseline -> clean), the salvage-then-heal quarantine/diff/manifest.jsonl
side effects, and the ingest-default-off / --dry-run-ingest contract — CARR_
DRIFT_INGEST unset (or 0) must never attempt a network call; this suite never
sets it to 1 without also passing --dry-run-ingest, so no test can ever
actually POST.

Exit 0 if every case passes, 1 otherwise.
