"""vault-drift-watch-selftest.py — prove the drift watch actually detects drift.

WHY THIS SHELLS OUT rather than importing ops/vault-drift-watch.py and calling
its functions directly: the artifact that matters is the SCRIPT AS INVOKED —
stdout report plus exit code — because that is what the nightly chain and
tools/health-check.py actually consume. An in-process import test could pass
while a real invocation's exit code path was broken (argv parsing, sys.exit
plumbing, an exception swallowed somewhere on the way out); the F10 lesson this
build brief cites is exactly that a claimed exit-code contract needs a real
subprocess test, not an assumption from reading the source.

Runs entirely against scratch roots under /private/tmp — never the real vault,
and never the real repo's out/ directory: every run() call passes its own
--baseline-dir / --quarantine-dir / --salvage-manifest / --summary under the
same per-case scratch base as --root / --manifest, so a test case can never
read or write anything the real nightly chain or a developer's own
--rebaseline touches.

v2 additions over the original 10-case suite: --rebaseline, the registry
tamper check against a rebaselined snapshot, the heal cycle (tamper ->
rebaseline -> clean), the salvage-then-heal quarantine/diff/manifest.jsonl
side effects, and the ingest-default-off / --dry-run-ingest contract — CARR_
DRIFT_INGEST unset (or 0) must never attempt a network call; this suite never
sets it to 1 without also passing --dry-run-ingest, so no test can ever
actually POST.

Exit 0 if every case passes, 1 otherwise.

# ── RETIRED-INTO-_to_delete, added 2026-08-16 ────────────────────────────────
# THE FALSE POSITIVE THIS CLOSES. The 2026-08-16 nightly reported three DELETED
# files as UNEXPECTED: 00_Context/sweep-sop.md, Automation/local-tasks/
# review-task.md and DNA/Network/briefs/2026-07-04-network-brief.md. None had
# been deleted. All three had been MOVED to _to_delete/ by the monthly sweep,
# each into a dated folder naming its reason, exactly as Joe's never-delete
# rule requires (faae6748: never delete, always stage into _to_delete).
#
# The cost was not the alarm, it was the reading: the session on duty took the
# report at face value and told Joe his monthly sweep procedure might have been
# deleted by something unknown. Filed as a defect against the class that has
# now failed 17 times. A checker that cries wolf every time the sweep does its
# job correctly trains its reader to be wrong.
#
# The rule: a vault .md that left its home and now exists under _to_delete/ was
# RETIRED by a sanctioned process. Deliberately narrow — it applies to DELETED
# paths only. An ADDED or MODIFIED file is untouched by this, and a file that
# simply vanished with no copy in _to_delete is still UNEXPECTED, because that
# is the real signal the alarm exists for.
