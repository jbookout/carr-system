"""peer-broadcast-gate-selftest.py — prove the gate blocks fan-out and nothing else.

The failure it guards is asymmetric: blocking a legitimate reply is worse than
letting one extra ask through, because a session that cannot answer a peer is
broken in a way that is hard to diagnose from the other end. So the allow cases
carry as much weight here as the deny case.

# the ref form. The gate keyed on the raw string, so `x` and `x [d7e9b2]` counted
# as two different sessions. A caller who had already reached `x` was then told
# `x [d7e9b2]` was "another one", while the refusal text listed `x` as already
# messaged in the same sentence. Neither spelling could be sent: bare was refused
# by the tool, ref-qualified by the gate.

# Identity is the NAME. The ref is a disambiguator the tool asks for, not part of
# who the peer is.

# 4c. A SESSION'S OWN SUBAGENTS ARE ORCHESTRATION, NOT BROADCAST.
#
# The false positive, hit 2026-08-14 (session db8cb4af): an orchestrating
# session spawned workers via the Agent tool and messaged them by agentId. The
# gate counted those workers as "sessions", filled the budget with them, and
# then refused the session's OWN next worker — listing one of its own subagents
# as an already-messaged peer in the refusal.
#
# The gate's rationale does not apply here. Its whole justification is the
# EXTERNALISED cost — the asker pays one message, every other session on the
# machine pays for reading and answering. A subagent's reply lands in the
# asker's own context; the asker pays the full cost itself. There is nobody to
# protect.
#
# Identity must be PROVEN, not pattern-matched: a recipient is exempt only when
# THIS session's transcript records spawning that agentId. A recipient merely
# SHAPED like an agentId is still a peer — otherwise naming a session
# 'a0123456789abcdef' would spend an unlimited budget.
