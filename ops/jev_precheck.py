"""jev_precheck.py — gather the facts that decide whether a shell command works.

THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE OF, run 2026-09-18 against 464 real
shell calls taken from one session's own transcript.

Asking a judgment "will this command fail?" over the COMMAND TEXT ALONE has no
discriminating power at all. Twenty-six calls that actually failed and
twenty-six that actually succeeded both scored a median of 0.44. At a 0.8
threshold the question caught fewer real failures than it raised false alarms.
A control set of successful commands is the only reason that is readable — the
failure scores on their own look respectable.

Ask the SAME question with ONE relevant environment fact attached and the same
eight commands separate at a median of 0.94 against 0.17, seven of eight right.
The facts that did it were mundane and all knowable in advance:

  · ops/ holds no __init__.py, so it is not a package and a relative import
    from a sibling module raises.
  · jev_judge.judge() returns the decoded response with answers nested under
    an "answers" key, so reading one level shallower raises.
  · ops/ci.sh has no --class option and exits on an unrecognised argument.
  · hooks/guard-unattended.py refuses any recursive or forced delete outright,
    whatever the target is.

So the judgment was never the hard part or the expensive part — one question is
around half a second and a fraction of a cent. THE WORK IS COLLECTING THE
FACTS, and that is ordinary deterministic code. This module is that code. It
does not call the model and it does not decide anything: it reads a command and
returns what is true about the things the command names.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It never runs the command, never imports a module to
inspect it, and never executes repository code to find out what that code does.
Importing a module to learn its interface runs everything at that module's top
level, which is exactly the side effect a pre-check exists to avoid. Every fact
below is read from text on disk.

IT IS A LIBRARY AND MUST STAY ONE. No shebang and no main guard: either turns a
.py file into a registered script entrypoint in the sealed source inventory,
moves the frontier, and owes a forward-only registry successor. The detector is
a regex over the whole file with no notion of docstrings, so the construct is
described here and never spelled. ops/typesafe_client.py carries the long form.
