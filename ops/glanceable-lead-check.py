"""ops/glanceable-lead-check.py — no lead-outreach reminders on a glanceable surface.

THE RULE (17ffd587, Joe, Jul 15/16 2026): never surface "call this lead / follow
up" on open-loops, the heartbeat, or the Monday brief. Leads live on The Lead
Board and Joe works them there. Its carve-out, in the rule's own words: a
follow-up DATE Joe sets on a real DEAL is the reminder system working — surface
it at the right time.

WHY IT NEEDS A CHECK RATHER THAN A HABIT. The surfaces this rule governs are
GENERATED. Nothing stopped a lead-outreach row being written into a loop and
rendering onto Joe's hot list the next morning; the rule held because sessions
remembered it, which is the exact shape rule ab814a26 was taught about.

WHAT IS A VIOLATION, and the narrowness is the whole design: a lead reference
sitting inside an OUTREACH INSTRUCTION. "Send Dr. X (L-221) the advisory" is the
shape the rule forbids.

WHAT IS NOT, each one a real line from the live surfaces or a near neighbour:
  · bookkeeping — "Registry L-004 stamp owed to the next writer" mentions a lead
    ref while doing filing, and flagging it would make the check cry about the
    system's own record-keeping until somebody muted it.
  · the CARVE-OUT — a dated follow-up on a deal (C-###) is the reminder system
    working. This check never looks at deal refs.
  · provenance — "the advisory came out of the L-221 intake" names a source.

THE HOT LIST IS GLANCEABLE; THE BACKLOG IS NOT. open-loops.md is always-read.
open-loops-backlog.md states in its own header that it is read on cadence rather
than every session, which is where a dormant lead item is allowed to live. The
brief sections under out/brief-pack/ are glanceable and are checked.

IT REPORTS; IT DOES NOT EDIT. The remedy for a real hit is to move the row to
The Lead Board, which is a judgement about that lead's state and belongs to a
session or to Joe, not to a regex.

    and a session baselined it as a known violation. Opening the RECORD showed
    Ramsey holds both a lead row and a client row (C-199) with a live deal, The

    dated follow-up on a real deal, which is precisely the carve-out rule

    "client with a deal"; only one of them is the answer.
