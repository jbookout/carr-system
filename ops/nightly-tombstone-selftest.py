"""nightly-tombstone-selftest.py — the four reliability contracts of the chain.

WHAT THIS DEFENDS, and why each half is here rather than being obvious.

The 2026-08-23 process-audit council found that roughly a third of bin/nightly.sh
did no work on a typical night — six steps refusing for a missing canonical seam,
four for an admin capability nobody has provisioned on this Mac, one retired
no-op still being executed — and that the chain had three reliability bugs worth
more than the wasted steps:

  1. TOMBSTONES. A step known in advance to be unable to work was executed anyway
     so that it could refuse, printing BLOCKED into out/nightly.log every night
     for a week or more. A word that appears nightly stops being read, and it is
     the same word a real break would use. Gating those steps out is only half
     the fix: the other half is that the duty must still be FILED (rule 1b8e7f43
     — a blocked action is filed, never dropped), so a tombstone names what is
     missing and what would reopen it.
  2. DEAD-MAN PINGS ON A STEP THAT DID NOT RUN. bin/hc-ping.sh used to ping
     NOTHING for exit 69, so a backup that did not happen went LATE instead of
     alarming. A cover path elsewhere is a reason the gap may not bite; it is not
     a reason to stop reporting it.
  3. A LIVE HOLDER THAT HAS STOPPED WORKING. On 2026-08-23 a stalled run held the
     singleton lock while very much alive, so pid liveness said "in progress" and
     two later launches exited 0 as duplicates. The night that completed started
     76 minutes late.
  4. A DEATH THAT LEFT NO LINE. On 2026-08-17, 08-18 and 08-19 an unset variable
     under `set -u` killed the chain where it stood. The shell's complaint went to
     stderr, which nothing was reading; out/nightly.log held nothing at all, and
     the dead-man pings are the last step so the chain never reached them. Three
     nights of no exports, no boards, no backup, every alarm green.

WHY IT RUNS THE REAL CODE AND NOT A COPY. Each case extracts the actual function
or block from bin/nightly.sh / bin/run-lock.sh and executes it. Asserting on
source text is how the previous version of the Drive-projection check came to
keep passing on a COMMENT after the chain stopped calling the script it named. A
test that pins behaviour survives the fix moving; a test that pins shape does not.

Nothing here touches the real vault, the real database, a real credential, the
real lock directory or the real Healthchecks account. The pings are aimed at a
throwaway HTTP server on localhost that records what it was asked for.

Exit 0 if every case passes, 1 otherwise.
