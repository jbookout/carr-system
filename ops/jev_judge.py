"""jev_judge.py — ask Jev a narrow question about a body of text, and RECORD it.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. CARR decides a great many things by matching strings: whether
a commit fixes the problem a claim describes, whether a response accounts for a
clause, whether a defect belongs in a class that already exists, whether a
doctrine section answers a question. Every one of those is a judgment about
text wearing a keyword table's clothing, and every one of them has misfired.
This module is the one place those judgments get asked properly.

IT IS A LIBRARY AND MUST STAY ONE. No shebang, no main guard, for the reason
ops/typesafe_client.py spells out at length: either one makes a .py file a
registered script entrypoint in the sealed source inventory, moves the frontier
and owes a forward-only registry successor. Callers are entrypoints that exist.
The detector is a regex over the whole file and does not know what a docstring
is, so describe the construct and never spell it.

record() IS THE AUDIT LOG, NOT A WAITING ROOM (Joe, 2026-09-24, decision
5ec806a4: "every jev check in the system too is not a shadow"). It used to be
that a caller wrote what the judgment WOULD have decided next to what the
existing mechanism DID decide, and returned without acting, moving to acting
only once the log showed agreement on real traffic. That default is retired:
every Jev check now acts on its own judgment. record() still writes what Jev
said beside what the caller decided, on every call, acting or not — the log is
now how each acting use is audited, not a precondition for turning it on. What
does not change: each acting use keeps its threshold (the value in place when
it started shadowing is the STARTING point, not re-guessed at the switchover),
keeps an abstention path (JudgeUnavailable, any other failure, or a low
confidence falls back to the caller's prior non-Jev behavior, visibly, never
an affirmative judgment), and keeps recording every judgment through this
function. This matters because a typed answer guarantees an answer's shape and
never its truth: a caller that acts on an unvalidated threshold converts a
model's uncertainty into a partner's blocked afternoon, so the threshold
still has to come from measurement, just not from a phase gate on this module.

THREE THINGS LEARNED THE EXPENSIVE WAY ON 2026-09-18, all of them shaping the
interface below:

  1. PICK THE SHAPE FROM THE JOB, AND THERE ARE TWO SHAPES. This entry said
     "one request per subject, never one request carrying every subject" as
     though it were a law. That is the RERANKING rule, it is real, and it is
     narrow: the vendor's reranking walkthrough scores query-and-candidate
     pairs one request at a time, no request seeing another — over a SHORTLIST
     OF THIRTY that a keyword search produced first. Reading it as universal
     was wrong and it cost this repository four modules built the expensive way.

     SELECTING FROM A ROSTER IS THE OTHER SHAPE, and the vendor's own examples
     are exactly that: 182 agent skills ranked in ONE Choice question, 218
     document line identifiers scored in ONE request. A Choice carries up to
     255 options, its probabilities sum to one across them, and an explicit
     "none of these fits" option is how it declines. Then, if anything, a close
     look at the top two or three.

     MEASURED HERE ON 2026-09-18, same held-out data, same corpus, the two
     shapes against each other on picking a defect class from 320:

         one Noul per class ....... 320 requests  12.5s  38% top-1  81% top-8
         one Choice, then a look ...  9 requests   1.4s  69% top-1  88% top-8

     And on finding the commit that answers a claim, over 214 commits: 214
     requests and 4.2 seconds became ONE request and 0.6 seconds, with the same
     four answers out of four, and with "nothing here answers this" arriving as
     a calibrated option rather than as a hand-set floor.

     THE TEST, so this does not get misread again: are the candidates competing
     for one slot, or is each independently true or false? Competing for a slot
     is a Choice over all of them. Independently true or false — several may
     apply, or none — is a Noul each, and then it belongs on a shortlist rather
     than on the whole roster. Truncate option text in the ranking pass and
     keep the full text for the close look; 255 full-length options returns
     HTTP 400 max_tokens_exceeded, which is how that stops being optional.

  1b. ASK EVERY INDEPENDENT QUESTION ABOUT ONE SUBJECT IN ONE REQUEST. This is
     the vendor's headline efficiency principle and the opposite of what the
     old entry above implied. Their measurement: thirteen questions about one
     document batched into a single call came out 12.2 times cheaper and 10
     times faster, and each question is scored on its own against the state, so
     an answer does not depend on what else rides along. A broad question that
     hides several judgments is the thing to avoid — decompose it into narrow
     ones and combine them in code, in ONE call, not in several.

  2. LOW CONFIDENCE IS THE ANSWER, NOT A FAILURE TO ANSWER. On the day this was
     written, Jev's wrong calls arrived under 0.5 confidence and its right ones
     above 0.8, twice in a row, on real code. A caller that ignores confidence
     throws away the most useful half of the signal.

  3. A QUESTION NOBODY THINKS TO ASK RETURNS NOTHING. Jev sharpened a review; it
     did not replace one. These judgments narrow where a human or a larger model
     looks. They do not decide that nobody needs to look.
