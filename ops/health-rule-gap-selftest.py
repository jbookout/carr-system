"""health-rule-gap-selftest.py — the active-rule-gap acceptance stays narrow.

THE PROBLEM, found 2026-08-21. `run.sh health` printed "⚠︎ active-rule-gaps 2
active admitted rules not hard-enforced" and nothing could ever clear it. The
query counted every active rule whose enforcement_status was not exactly
'hard_enforced', and the two it flagged were both working as designed:

  · the rule requiring a whole path be exercised before a capability is called
    live carries a real stop gate (hooks/completion-evidence-gate.py, wired in
    ~/.claude/settings.json), recorded in ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json
    as enforcement_class stop_gate with control completion_evidence;
  · Joe's rule that a permanently chosen machine state must be read as accepted
    is recorded there as judgment_ambient with a written why_unenforceable —
    "No control can judge whether a human chose a state on purpose."

So the check was doing to a deliberate state exactly what that second rule
forbids: leaving it red forever. Two corrections went in — 'authority_enforced'
counts as enforced (migrations/0194_atomic_rule_approval.sql allows exactly
hard_enforced, authority_enforced and blocked), and the one judgment class is
accepted rather than counted.

WHAT THIS TEST IS FOR. Rule bd4a6d22 does not merely permit a named acceptance,
it constrains one: name the accepted thing exactly, keep it an explicit
constant, keep printing it on the passing line, and never widen a pattern or
delete an assertion to make a check quiet. Everything outside the named
acceptance must still fail, AND there must be a test proving it still fails.
This is that test. Its fixtures are written against the constants themselves, so
the way to break the gate — quietly widening RULE_UNENFORCEABLE_CLASS to cover
another class, or adding 'blocked' to the enforced states to zero the count — is
the way to fail this file.
