"""stale-config-check.py — you may not overwrite a generated file you have not seen.

THE FAILURE, twice on 2026-08-14 and damaging both times.

  ops/ci.sh. Pull request 60 added a type-check class that treated a missing
  mypy as SKIP. Pull request 65, cut BEFORE 60 existed, replaced the whole class
  with its own older copy that reported a false failure instead — and merged
  second, so it won. A machine without mypy then failed CI with "mypy found
  shape mistakes", which is wrong and misdirects whoever reads it.

  ops/config/gate-baseline.json. Pull request 70 changed a gate and re-blessed
  its hash in the same commit, exactly as the baseline's own instructions
  require. A concurrent pull request cut before it blessed from the older base
  and merged after, carrying the pre-70 hash. Main then shipped a gate whose
  recorded hash did not match its own file, so every session booted into GATE
  INTEGRITY FAILURE until somebody re-blessed it by hand.

WHY NOTHING CAUGHT EITHER, and why this is not solvable by reviewing harder.
Each branch is internally consistent and passes CI alone. The damage does not
exist until the two are combined on main, and git reports no conflict because
the second branch rewrote the whole region rather than editing around it. This
is a LOST UPDATE, not a merge conflict.

WHY ONLY THESE FILES. They are GENERATED — rewritten wholesale by tooling rather
than edited line by line — so two branches touching them almost never conflict
textually; they silently overwrite each other. ops/config/gate-baseline.json
took THIRTY-SIX commits on main in twenty-four hours. A hand-written source file
would have conflicted loudly and been noticed.

THE RULE: if your branch modifies a watched file, the newest commit on
origin/main touching that same file must already be in your history.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE, stated plainly because a guard oversold is worse than
none. It runs when CI runs. If main gains a new commit to a watched file AFTER
this passes and BEFORE the merge button, the same lost update can still happen in
that window. Closing it completely needs GitHub's own "require branches to be up
to date before merging" on the ruleset, which forces every pull request to
rebase whenever main moves at all — real protection at the cost of constant
churn across every branch, and a call for Joe rather than for this file. This
check buys the common case, which is a branch cut hours ago against a file that
changes many times a day.
