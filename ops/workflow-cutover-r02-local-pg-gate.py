"""Rollback-only real-Postgres proof for the DoctorCRE V5-R02 SQL doors
(migrations 0593 and 0599), run ONLY under production-shaped logins.

WHY THE LOGINS MATTER. PR #1245's re-review found three defects this gate had
been passing over: it asked the doors under grants and routing production
does not have (a superuser session, `SET ROLE carr_authority` on a login, and
a test-only `grant carr_writer to carr_authority_joe`). So every door call
below -- refusal or success -- runs after `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` to one
of three logins holding exactly one runtime bundle each, as production does:

  carr_authority_joe  member of carr_authority only (0161/0273: the partner's
                      authority login that authorityOnly verbs connect as);
  r02gate_writer      member of carr_writer only (the MCP writer login);
  r02gate_jobs        member of carr_jobs only (the job runner's login).

The gate checks those memberships before it starts and refuses to run if
carr_authority_joe also holds carr_writer or carr_jobs. The superuser session
only writes FIXTURE rows the doors read (job definitions, acceptance rows,
legacy surfaces and disable receipts) and probes the append-only triggers as
table owner; it never calls a door.

Covered:
  P1-a  an open plan never stops an already-live workflow: live and canary
        enqueue keep working at read_legacy..shadow_compare; from
        single_write_authority only LIVE is gated (fresh canary + disabled
        legacy surfaces), canary never is; cancel ends the gating at once.
        open / supersede / advance / cancel / retire are authority-only.
  P1-b  slice completion is reachable in production: register and complete
        on the authority login, progress on the writer login; each refused
        on the other login.
  P1-c  criteria cannot be beaten: [A, A] never satisfies {A, B}; evidence
        resolves only against each criterion's registered workflow, evidence
        type and mode/stage.
  P3    retire derives the census itself: no caller argument exists for it,
        and a fully valid plan + receipt is refused for the census, last.
  and the earlier review items: 'retired' is terminal for advance (the
  array_position NULL guard), retire's receipt checks (version, predates
  cutover, one-use, every legacy surface), record_workflow_caller's
  registered-workflow check and append-only history.
