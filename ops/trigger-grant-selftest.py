trigger-grant-selftest.py — fixtures for ops/trigger-grant-check.py, written
before it (rule e65efc68).

THE RULE, 5409731b: a new trigger changes the permission surface of every verb
that writes its table. Before the migration ships, list every table the trigger
body reads and confirm the WRITING role holds SELECT on each. A plain foreign-key
check runs as the referenced table's owner and needs no grant; an invoker-rights
plpgsql trigger runs AS THE CALLER and dies on any ungranted read.

WHAT IT COST WHEN SKIPPED, from the rule's own text: 0060's side-validation
trigger read participant_role, which 0017 had left ungranted. set-lead broke
silently in production for five days (2026-08-03 to 2026-08-08), invisible
because the existing lead rows were import-written and every rehearsal ran as
owner. Grants never fire for the owner, so rehearsing as owner cannot catch it.

WHY THIS ASKS POSTGRES INSTEAD OF READING THE SQL. A static version was
prototyped first and it reported ZERO gaps — not because there were none, but
because its grant parsing found no writers at all and the loop never ran. Green
meant "parsed nothing". The permission model here is genuinely subtle: 0004's
`grant ... on all tables in schema public` is a ONE-TIME grant that does not
reach any table created afterwards, which is precisely why participant_role
(created in 0060) was ungranted. Reimplementing that in a regex is where false
confidence lives. has_table_privilege() and has_column_privilege() are the
authority, and pg_trigger/pg_proc enumerate the triggers, so the only textual
step left is pulling table names out of prosrc — and even those are validated
against pg_class, so a CTE name or a keyword cannot become a phantom table.

THE COLUMN-GRANT TRAP, which a table-level check gets wrong in the direction
that matters. 0078 fixed the incident with `grant select (side) on
participant_role to carr_writer`. has_table_privilege() returns FALSE for that
— so a table-only check flags today's healthy schema as broken, which is a
false DENY on a fix that is already in place. Access is table-level OR any
column-level.

THE STATED GAP, documented rather than papered over: a column grant that is too
NARROW — present, but not covering the column the trigger actually reads — is
not detected, because deciding which columns a trigger body reads means parsing
plpgsql, and a guess there would be exactly the kind that gets a check deleted.
What is caught is no read access at all, which is what the incident was.

WHAT MUST STAY TRUE:
  1. The historical incident is caught: revoke the grant that fixed it and the
     check fails, naming the trigger, the table read, and the role.
  2. Today's schema PASSES, column grant and all. This is the direction a
     table-only check loses.
  3. A SECURITY DEFINER function is never flagged — it does not run as caller.
  4. A role that cannot write the trigger's table is never asked about.
  5. Names in prosrc that are not real tables never become findings.
  6. With no database it SKIPS rather than passing, because a check that cannot
     look and reports OK is worse than one that says it did not run.

RUNNING IT. Needs a throwaway Postgres; skips cleanly without one:
