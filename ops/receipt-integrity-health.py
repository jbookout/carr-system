"""Health line for the server-side Jev call log's tamper audit.

The Jev call receipt store (migrations/0587) is DETECTABLE, NOT PREVENTED
against its own database owner: the model's OS user can read the owner
credential, so it can insert, backdate or delete receipt rows or disable the
append-only trigger. This check is the detection half. It asks the deployed
Worker for `read-jev-call-receipt-integrity` through the ordinary local verb
door (`./run.sh call`, no credential of its own) and turns the answer into one
health line:

  OK    every receipt has its ask-jev tool_call row and the triggers are on
  FAIL  a receipt has no matching tool_call row, or a trigger is not enabled,
        or the audit could not be read at all
  SKIP  the Worker does not serve the verb yet (unknown_tool: not deployed)

A trigger disabled and re-enabled between two runs is not seen.

The first line of stdout is the line ./run.sh health prints; the exit status
is 0 for OK/SKIP and 1 for FAIL.
