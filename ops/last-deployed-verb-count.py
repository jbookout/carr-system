"""last-deployed-verb-count.py — what the last deploy of this service to this
environment actually shipped, read from the ledger.

WHY THIS EXISTS. bin/deploy-worker.sh refuses a deploy that would remove verbs,
and it needs a previous number to compare against. That number used to live in
mcp-server/.last-deployed-verb-count.<env>, a file the deploy wrote and the
postflight told you to commit. Committing it fails ops/release-manifest-selftest.py
(defect d737c09c): manifest artifact_paths are ['mcp-server','dealroom'], so the
file sits inside the digested artifact while the digest skips dotfiles — moving
the deployed tree without moving its digest, which is the exact condition that
test guards.

THE FILE WAS ALWAYS A DUPLICATE. Every deploy already records `--verb-count`
into ops.deployment, and since the 2026-08-16 ledger fix it does so for staging
as well as production. Write law 14181e60 settles which copy survives: the
database is the source, a file exists only where a machine requires one, and
nothing requires this one.

ONE CODE PATH, TWO CALLERS (rule a8c55a47): the deploy asks this, and so can CI
or a human. A second copy of the query in shell would be free to drift.

EXIT CODES, and the shell caller depends on telling them apart:
  0   a previous deployment exists; its verb count is printed on stdout
  3   no prior deployment for this service+environment — a genuine first deploy,
      which must be allowed to establish the baseline rather than refused forever
  78  no credential in this environment (EX_CONFIG, the convention bin/nightly.sh
      and bin/run-scheduled.sh already use for "not configured here")
  1   the ledger exists but could not be read — the caller must FAIL CLOSED

WHY FAIL CLOSED IS CHEAP HERE, stated so nobody softens it later: the Worker
being deployed needs Postgres for every verb it serves. A deploy attempted while
the ledger is unreachable would ship something that cannot work anyway. Refusing
costs nothing real, and a loss guard that cannot check must never wave a deploy
through — that is how the 2026-08-09 verb loss happened, when production went
from 75 verbs to 66 and nothing objected.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (defect 4077b653, 2026-08-22). `verb_count is not null` in
    baseline_row above is part of the definition of a baseline, and it has to
    be — a row with no count cannot be compared against. But skipping such a row
    SILENTLY means the guard keeps answering with an older number and printing
    OK, which is a loss guard reporting on a state of the world that has moved.

    That is not hypothetical twice over. baseline_row's own docstring records it
    holding at 141 while production served 143 on 2026-08-20. It then happened
    again structurally: `--promote-version` skips the preflight that sets the
    shipping count, Production source deploys are disabled outright, so every
    Production release records no count and the baseline froze at 143 while
    production served 146. The producer half is fixed in bin/deploy-worker.sh;
    this half makes the freeze VISIBLE rather than trusting that it never
    recurs, because the first failure was already written down in a docstring
    and that did not stop the second.

    Reported, never fatal here. The caller decides — see the STALE BASELINE
    block in bin/deploy-worker.sh for why it warns loudly rather than refusing:
    refusing would block a legitimate release on a bookkeeping gap in rows that
    already exist, which is a control lowering the floor it was meant to raise
    (decision 91020f79).
