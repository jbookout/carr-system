"""store-markup-scan.py — hunt tool-call markup across EVERY text column in the
record layer, not just the rule table.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-13 six ACTIVE rules were found carrying literal
tool-call markup: a malformed parameter made the statement swallow its own
closing tag plus every parameter after it, and those parameters were written
NULL. Rule c53beeaa documents the defect and prescribes the check; nothing ran
it, and the corruption sat in binding text for four days.

The rules were then covered by ops/rule-render-markup-check.py. But the same
write path serves every verb that takes prose — deal notes, findings, loop
bodies, decision rationales, client records, doctrine sections. c53beeaa names
those explicitly ("a decision's rationale absorbed into human_quote, and loop
#146's and #159's unblocks and source_note into body"), so the record side was
known to be affected and had never been swept.

READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION: connects with the exporter role via
exporters/common.connect(). It finds and reports; it repairs nothing, because
the repair needs the absorbed text read first and each parameter returned to its
own field, which is a judgment call per row.

OUTPUT IS DELIBERATELY REDACTED. It prints table, column, primary key and a
short window around the marker — enough to locate and triage a row, without
dumping client prose into a transcript.

    # Ruled 2026-08-14 on Joe's "fix this", after establishing three things:
    #   1. Nothing was lost. source_note swallowed </source_note> and the whole
    #      unblocks field after it, but the absorbed text is still readable in
    #      source_note, and both fields are transcribed verbatim into loop #379.
    #   2. It cannot be repaired. update-loop refuses a closed row on purpose —
    #      "a closed loop is history; open a new one rather than editing the
    #      record of what happened" — and that refusal is the design working.
    #   3. The loop was closed correctly on its merits at 05:57; the corruption
    #      is cosmetic and does not touch what the record says happened.
    # The cause is now closed at the write door (looksLikeToolCallMarkup in
    # mcp-server/src/tools.js), so this set should stop growing rather than
    # becoming the routine landing place for new damage. If it grows again, the
    # guard is not holding and that is the thing to fix, not this list.
