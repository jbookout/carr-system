"""mechanism-doctrine-gate.py — a new mechanism ships with its doctrine, or it
does not ship.

THE RULING (open loop 504, the flaw-fix package; Joe adopted it through the
2026-08-21 tune-up council): "Knowledge ships with the mechanism: any new
mechanism lands with its doctrine section in the same change, as a compiled
admission check rather than prose."

The last four words are the whole design. There has been a written expectation
that a new gate, hook or scheduled job arrives with an explanation of what it is
for, and it has been honoured about as well as written expectations usually are
— which is why the repository has accumulated mechanisms nobody can account for.
Two of them were cleared the same day this file was written: two Program 1
environment gates that ran nowhere at all, and a launchd job loaded on Joe's Mac
with no plist behind it. In each case the mechanism existed and the knowledge of
why did not, and in each case somebody spent an afternoon reconstructing it.

WHAT COUNTS AS A NEW MECHANISM, deliberately narrow. Only files ADDED by the
change under review, and only these four kinds:

    ops/*-gate.py            a check that can refuse work
    hooks/*.py               a gate that runs inside the session
    ops/launchd/*.plist      a job that runs on its own schedule
    ops/scheduled-tasks/*    a job that asks an AI client to act later

These four share the property that makes the rule worth enforcing: each one
changes what the system does WITHOUT anyone asking it to, so a reader who meets
it later cannot work out its purpose by looking at who called it. A library, a
test fixture or an ordinary script is not covered — those are read by the code
that calls them, and the call site is the explanation.

MODIFYING an existing mechanism is not covered either. The rule is about
knowledge arriving WITH a mechanism, not about re-justifying every edit, and a
gate that demanded a doctrine slug on every touch would be uninstalled within a
week.

WHAT IT REQUIRES: a declaration line naming the doctrine section that explains
the mechanism.

    # doctrine: <slug>

for Python, and `doctrine: <slug>` inside a comment or key for the other two.
The slug is the document's own name in the doctrine store — the thing
`read-doctrine` takes — never a file path, because the generated markdown
renders were retired on 2026-08-19 and a path is a pointer to something that no
longer exists.

WHY A DECLARATION RATHER THAN A DIFF CHECK. The obvious implementation is to
demand that the same commit also touch a doctrine file. It cannot be done: since
the cutoff, doctrine lives in the store and not in this repository, so there is
no file in any diff to look for. The declaration is the part that CAN be
compiled, and it is the part that carries the knowledge forward — a slug in the
file survives every future reader, where a commit message is read once.

WHEN THE STORE IS REACHABLE the slug is also RESOLVED, so a declaration naming
a document that does not exist fails the same as no declaration at all. That is
the half that stops this becoming a box-ticking exercise. When the store is not
reachable — CI runners have no credential by construction — the resolution is
skipped and SAID to be skipped, and the static check still stands.

Exit 0 clean · 1 a new mechanism has no usable doctrine declaration · 2 could
not determine the change under review, which is not a pass.
