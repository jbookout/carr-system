"""The corpus push must judge each root on its own, and must not revive the vault.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23). `tools/corpus-sync.py --push` gated the entire run
on one probe: unless the vault resolved as a directory, it returned 78 and
pushed nothing. That was correct while every row in the corpus set lived in the
vault. It stopped being correct when the set gained `home:` rows, which address
~/.claude/skills on this Mac and need no Drive at all — twelve of the fifty-four.
After the 2026-08-19 cutoff retired the vault, one dead root was switching off a
dozen live rows. A step with a live half and a dead half fails whole, and the
live half goes quiet without anyone deciding it should.

AND THE SUBTLER HALF, which is the one worth a permanent test. The obvious repair
is to probe each root for reachability. That is wrong here and would have been
worse than the bug: the Drive mount still resolves on this Mac, so a reachability
probe says yes and the push would rewrite retired doctrine renders back into the
vault the cutoff turned off. Being able to write somewhere is not permission to.
Drive-rooted rows therefore move only inside an explicitly opened recovery
envelope, and the retirement — not the mount — is what decides them.

Both properties are asserted here because each one alone is satisfied by a
version that breaks the other: gate on reachability and the vault comes back;
gate on the vault for everything and the home rows go quiet.

Needs no Drive, no network and no database: it calls the classifier directly.
