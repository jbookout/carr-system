"""Fingerprint and success-clears, driven end to end as carr_jobs on real Postgres.

WHAT THE OTHER TWO GUARDS CANNOT SEE. ops/incident-fingerprint-selftest.py holds
the decision rules and touches no database. Migration 0293's own proof block
holds ops.clear_recovered_incident and touches no Python. Between them sits the
thing that actually has to work on 2026-08-23: tools/ops-record.py writing a run
row AS THE JOB ROLE and having the right thing happen to the incident ledger.

That seam is where this change could fail silently and still look green. The
close path it replaces failed exactly there — ops-record.py sweep is correct
Python over a correct schema, and it has never once run in production, because
carr_jobs has no grant on resolved_at and bin/nightly.sh runs as carr_jobs. A
test that connects as the owner would have proved that path healthy every night
while the fleet accumulated 26 open incidents. So this connects as carr_jobs and
nothing else, and the first thing it asserts is that the role it is using still
cannot reach resolved_at by any route but the function.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY CANNOT DISTINGUISH, found by mutating the writer under it.
Lowering HEALTHY_RUNS_TO_CLEAR to 2, or adding SEV-1 to AUTO_CLEARED_SEVERITIES,
leaves every assertion below still passing — because ops.clear_recovered_incident
clamps the sequence to three and refuses SEV-1 itself, so the OUTCOME stays
correct while the Python is wrong. That is the layering working as designed and
not a hole: both mutations are caught by migration 0293's proof block (cases 5
and 7) and by ops/incident-fingerprint-selftest.py, which assert the rule rather
than the outcome. Recorded here so a later reader does not mistake the silence
for coverage.

Needs a disposable loopback cluster; ops/local-pg-ci.py supplies one and runs
this in its acceptance chain. Exits 78 when there is no such cluster to use.
