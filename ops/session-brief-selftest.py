"""Selftest for hooks/session-brief.py's nightly_verdict().

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-14 the brief opened the session with five named
nightly failures — two golden-workflow assertions, the golden workflow suite,
schema snapshot drift, and the vault drift watch. Only the LAST of those was
still failing; the other four had been fixed hours earlier and their runs had
already gone green on the parts that mattered. The accumulator was deduped at
each run boundary but never reset, so the line reported the union of every
failure since the last fully green chain and read as one catastrophic run.

That is the same disease this function was written to cure. Its own docstring
says a line that prints every session is a line nobody reads; a line that names
four already-fixed failures is worse, because the one real failure hides among
them, and the session pays to rediscover which.

SECOND INCIDENT, 2026-08-21, same disease in loose_work(). The brief opened a
session with "1 tracked file(s) in ~/carr-system have sat uncommitted for 324h".
The only dirty tracked path was the git submodule tools/dictation-rig/vendor/quill,
whose actual edit was 29 hours old. getmtime() had been called straight on the
path git status printed, and for a gitlink that path is a DIRECTORY: a directory's
mtime does not move when a file nested inside it is edited, so the number was
frozen at the submodule's checkout date and could only ever climb. Worse, the
submodule was dirty by DESIGN — its diff is byte-identical to the committed patch
tools/dictation-rig/patches/0001-menubar-visible-recording.patch, which the build
applies — so the line was announcing a permanent steady state as if it were
someone's stranded work, which is precisely the "line nobody reads" failure.
