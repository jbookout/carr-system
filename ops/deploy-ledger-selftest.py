"""deploy-ledger-selftest.py — every deploy records that it happened, staging
included. Fixtures written before the fix (rule e65efc68).

THE FAILURE, 2026-08-16, defect cb65fc17. The first approved release in this
system's history shipped to staging, read back clean, and wrote NO row to
ops.deployment. The table held exactly one row and it belonged to a different
session's production release.

THE CAUSE, read out of bin/deploy-worker.sh rather than guessed: all three
`record_deployment` call sites live INSIDE

    if [ "$TARGET_ENV" = "production" ] && [ -x .../smoke-and-record.sh ]; then

so a staging deploy reaches none of them.

WHY THAT BLOCK IS PRODUCTION-ONLY, AND WHY THAT PART IS CORRECT. The script's own
header explains it: smoke-reads.sh defaults to the production API, and a staging
deploy prints its workers.dev trigger from wrangler rather than from anything the
script holds, so aiming the suite at staging would mean reconstructing a hostname
this file would have to keep in sync with wrangler.toml. Pointing post-deploy
verification at the wrong hostname is what the 2026-08-13 routes incident was
made of. That refusal stays.

WHAT WAS WRONG IS THE NESTING, NOT THE REFUSAL. Running the golden suite and
recording that a deploy happened are different facts. The first is genuinely
production-only. The second is the Program 3 job ledger, which Program 5's
promotion path reads, and a staging deploy that leaves no row is indistinguishable
from a staging deploy that never ran.

THE STATE FOR A STAGING DEPLOY IS `verifying`, NOT `complete`, and the script
already defines that word for exactly this case: the suite could not run, so
nothing was proven. Migration 0115 refuses `complete` without a read-back, which
is the constraint doing its job. Automating the staging read-back so it could
honestly claim `complete` is Program 5 work (production read-back is a Program 5
bullet), deliberately not smuggled in here.

The structural fixtures parse the shipped script. Program 5's post-promotion
failure semantics are also executed in a temporary fake repo with mocked
Wrangler, curl, smoke, and ledger commands; no Cloudflare or database call runs.
