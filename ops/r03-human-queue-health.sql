-- Read-only V5-R03 standing check. Run with tools/db-tap.py sql on a database
-- where 0736 has landed. Counts metadata only; no titles or bodies are returned.
-- A persisted in-app row is not evidence that a human saw or acknowledged it.
-- notification-feed uses a read-only writer connection; before read-call audit
-- coverage of that route is deployed, zero tool_read_call rows do not establish
-- zero feed reads. Even after coverage, a successful call does not prove sight.
-- failed_attempts is historical; unresolved_failed_attempts counts failures
-- only while their recipient still lacks an in-app row.
