one-repo-gate-selftest.py — acceptance test for hooks/one-repo-gate.py,
written before the gate (rule e65efc68: write the test before the thing, and
especially before a gate).

WHY THE GATE EXISTS. CARR's CLAUDE.md rev 10 says the code lives in ONE repo,
jbookout/carr-system, and a session that cannot reach it must STOP and say so
rather than improvise a home. That is prose, so it binds only the sessions that
read it and obey it — which is exactly how it failed. A cloud session that could
not see carr-system filed an entire system audit plus two specs into an empty
scaffold repo and hand-wrote a DECISIONS.md duplicating what the add-loop verb
already does. Nothing refused it, and nobody found it by looking.

THE MECHANISM THIS ROW ORIGINALLY NAMED DOES NOT WORK, and that is worth keeping
here so nobody re-proposes it. The DirectoryAdded event is real, but it is a
POST-ACTION event: the directory is already registered when it fires, and every
non-zero exit goes to the debug log only. A hook there is an audit line, not a
control.

WHAT DOES WORK is the door the failure actually came through. The shape is not
"a directory got registered", it is "engineering work got WRITTEN somewhere that
is not the repo" — a PreToolUse Write gate, the same door record-home-gate.py and
gate-edit-gate.py already sit on, which does deny.

WHAT THIS MUST GET RIGHT, and most of it is about what it must NOT do:

  1. WORKTREES ARE THE REPO. run.sh worktree is the house default for any session
     that will commit (rule 4a53ff82), so a worktree lives at
     ~/carr-system/.claude/worktrees/<name> and its .git is a FILE pointing back
     at the canonical .git. A gate that compared directory prefixes naively would
     deny every worktree session's first Python file and be turned off the same
     day. Case 4 is the one that matters most.

  2. CREATION, NOT EDITING. The failure shape is new work landing in a foreign
     home. Patching a file that already exists in some other checkout is ordinary
     and legitimate, and denying it would be the over-parsing the loop warned
     breeds the habit of disabling the gate.

  3. NOT-A-REPO IS NOT THIS GATE'S BUSINESS. Scratchpads, /tmp and the vault are
     owned by other controls or by nothing. A gate that fires everywhere is a
     gate people learn to ignore — lint-gate.py's doctrine, and it applies here.

  4. FAIL OPEN ON ERROR, closed only on a real match. A gate that wedges a
     session costs more than the marginal safety of failing closed.

KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than discovered later: this covers Write/Edit/MultiEdit
only. A `python3 -c` heredoc from Bash writes the same file and is not seen —
the identical hole loop #287 documents in record-home-gate.py, whose fix is a
design question about parsing arbitrary shell for write targets. Naming it here
so this gate is never mistaken for complete coverage.

Hermetic: every case builds throwaway git repos and never touches the real one.
