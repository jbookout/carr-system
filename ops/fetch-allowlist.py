"""fetch-allowlist.py — the fetchable-host list, DERIVED FROM THE RECORD.

WHY (Joe, 2026-08-09: "build A and B", after the deal-history research slice ran
half-blind and filed four of fifteen clients found:false).

THE ERROR THIS FIXES. `KNOWN_HOSTS` in hooks/guard-unattended.py is trust encoded
as CODE. That is right for infrastructure — the Worker, Neon, R2, a licensing
board — because those are a fixed set somebody decided once. It is wrong for
client practice websites, which are a different host per client, unknown until
the client exists, and growing every week. Encoding them in code means the list
grows by one hand-edit per client, forever, and every edit is a session asking
to widen a security allowlist. That does not scale and it should not.

So this half of the fix makes the list DATA: the hosts a session may fetch are
the code list UNION the domains already recorded against real people in the
book.

WHERE THE DOMAINS COME FROM, and why not a website column. The obvious design was
a `website` field on the party record. Rejected on 2026-08-09 for two reasons.
First, no such column exists, so it needs a migration against a production
database shared with Dell, to store something the record already implies. Second
and larger: a website column would be written by SESSIONS during research, and a
list a session can append to is not a control — it is a session granting itself
access and writing the permission slip afterwards.

EMAIL DOMAINS avoid both. `kaydee@gulfcoastpelvichealth.com` names the practice's
own domain; the field is partner-entered at intake; and the standing doctrine
that identity fields are never edited on research alone already governs it. The
list maintains itself as the book grows, with no migration and no new surface.

HONEST LIMIT, because this is a security boundary and overclaiming one is worse
than not having it. The `update-party-contact` verb CAN write an email, so a
determined or injected session could in principle add a domain and then fetch it.
What this buys is not impossibility, it is ATTRIBUTION: widening now requires
writing an audited, attributed, human-visible record against a named party,
instead of silently reaching an arbitrary host. Audited widening, not blocked
widening. Anyone reading this should not believe otherwise.

FREE-MAIL IS EXCLUDED and that is the load-bearing filter. 16 of 39 client
addresses are gmail.com. Allowlisting gmail.com because a client uses Gmail would
hand every session the whole of Google's mail infrastructure on the strength of
one doctor's personal address. The same reasoning covers carr.us: our own domain
is not a client practice site.
