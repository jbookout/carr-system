"""rule_trigger_compile.py — Jev judges a rule once, when it is taught or changed.

THE PROBLEM, measured on 2026-09-25. ops/jev_rule_select.advise() ran at every
UserPromptSubmit: one ranking Choice plus one binding Noul for each of twenty
shortlisted rules, 21 Jev requests a prompt. That day it ran 632 times (13,272
requests, about half of all Jev traffic), 514 of them on machine-generated
task notifications rather than partner messages, and the verdicts it paid for
were mostly thrown away afterwards: only pack-layer rules can be delivered at
that seam (lib/rule_delivery_preuse.semantic_delivery), and it judged the
whole roster.

THE RE-ENGINEERED SHAPE. The judgment "which cues should surface this rule"
does not change from turn to turn; it changes when the rule does. So Jev is
asked ONCE PER RULE here, and its answers are stored as deterministic triggers
keyed to the rule's statement digest:

  * code proposes a bounded candidate set per rule — distinctive words and
    phrases of the statement, the pack's own keyword list, quoted forms the
    rule itself names, verbs, command families and paths it mentions, and
    n-grams from real moments where Jev previously judged the rule binding;
  * Jev decides, one Noul per candidate in ONE request per rule, which of
    them signal the rule's binding moment, which are near-misses (on topic,
    usually not binding), and whether the rule is instead always-on or has no
    reliable surface cue at all (a RESIDUAL rule, the only kind still judged
    at run time — ops/rule_trigger_delivery.py);
  * ops/rule-jit-compile.py turns the stored answers into rows of the one
    compiled trigger table (ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json), so run-time
    delivery is a pure match with no Jev call.

A LIBRARY. The command line is ops/rule-trigger-compile.py; this file carries
no entrypoint construct, for the sealed-inventory reason
ops/typesafe_client.py documents.
