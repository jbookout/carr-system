"""rule-gold-label-selftest.py -- acceptance test for the v2 rule-delivery
benchmark: the labeller (ops/rule_gold_label.py, CLI tools/rule-gold-label.py),
the committed fixture (ops/fixtures/rule-delivery-eval/cases.v2.json with its
labels and adjudications), the regression intake
(tools/rule-delivery-eval-intake.py), and the harness's v2 additions (split
filtering, per-rule-class and fully-served scoring).

Offline: no Jev request, no record-layer call, no write outside a throwaway
directory.

WHAT IS PROVEN:
  1. The rule gold's REVIEW SET: no auto-gold at the top, the per-rule lower
     bound, an action signal pulls a low-scored case in, an exact signal
     settles its rule on every case, a signal_implies_gold entry settles gold
     on every case carrying it; a missing adjudication or one outside the set
     stops the build. (The doctrine target keeps the band: p >= YES_AT gold,
     p <= NO_AT not, a borderline pair with no adjudication stops the build.)
  2. The committed gold is REPRODUCIBLE: rebuilding it from the committed
     first-pass probabilities, action signals and adjudications gives exactly
     the fixture's gold, for every case; exact and signal-implied labels are
     the same on every case carrying the signal (the model-routing rule on
     every subagent dispatch).
  3. Every adjudication carries a written reason, and every review-set pair has
     exactly one.
  4. The split is fixed by seed: recomputing it reproduces every case's split;
     each stratum holds out ceil(30%); a later case is placed by hash without
     moving any existing case.
  5. The fixture is big enough and clean: at least 200 cases, all eight strata
     with at least 20 each, every gold id a live rule the probabilities cover,
     and no email, phone, money figure, hostname URL, IP, credential path or
     token anywhere in it.
  6. Rule classes follow the ordered questions: every live rule gets exactly one
     of the four, layer0 is always_on, control is gate_named.
  7. The harness scores v2: load_cases filters by split, per-class counts and
     the fully-served share match hand counts, and the CLI runs on the train
     split and writes the class table.
  8. The regression intake: a live miss becomes a case with the missed rule
     gold, borderline rules disputed, a hash-placed split; a copied prompt, a
     copied tool-call input, a record name (never echoed), a bare host, a
     machine name, a key or ssh path, a scrub hit, an unknown rule or a
     duplicate is refused; every refusal happens BEFORE any Jev request (the
     CLI's main() is run with a stub client that counts requests); the name
     check fails closed; the command line appends to a fixture copy.
  9. The universal-trigger policy: the rules UNIVERSAL_POLICY settles carry
     exactly the policy's label on every case.
 10. Doctrine scoring sets aside refs outside a case's labelled shortlist and
     does not score paths that deliver no doctrine; the harness refuses a
     slug-shaped doctrine ref; with no --split a v2 file is scored on test.
