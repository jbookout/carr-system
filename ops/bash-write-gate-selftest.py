bash-write-gate-selftest.py — acceptance test for hooks/bash-write-gate.py,
written before the gate (rule e65efc68).

WHY THE GATE EXISTS, proven in one session on 2026-08-09 rather than theorised:
the linkedin-engagement-daily run wrote a vault markdown file with a `python3 -c`
command from Bash and it SUCCEEDED. Minutes later the identical change attempted
through Edit was BLOCKED with record-home-gate.py's full refusal text. Nothing
about the content differed. THE SAME CONTENT IS REFUSED OR ALLOWED PURELY BY
WHICH TOOL CARRIES IT, because every write gate matches Write|Edit|MultiEdit and
Bash is a door none of them watch.

That run had no intent to bypass anything. It reached for Bash because the
content contained URLs another guard had just refused, and discovered the write
gate only when Edit refused a follow-up correction. An unintentional bypass by a
compliant session is stronger evidence that a control is mis-scoped than a
deliberate one would be — and it sets the threat model this file is written
against. The adversary here is CARELESSNESS, not evasion.

THE DESIGN QUESTION THE LOOP LEFT OPEN, and the answer taken. Three options were
on the table: parse Bash for write targets, protect the paths at the filesystem
level, or accept Bash as trusted and move enforcement somewhere it can be
complete. The problem with the first as stated is real — under-parsing leaves the
hole, over-parsing blocks legitimate work and breeds the habit of switching the
gate off.

What makes it tractable is refusing to write a THIRD POLICY. Two gates already
hold the judgment about where a write may land: record-home-gate.py owns the
vault, one-repo-gate.py owns code outside the repo. A Bash gate that re-decided
either would be the two-homes disease one layer down, and the copies would drift.
So this gate decides NOTHING. It extracts candidate write TARGETS from a shell
command and hands each to the existing policies unchanged — one judgment, three
doors, which is rule a8c55a47 (a manual path and an automated path that do the
same job must be the same code) applied to tool doors rather than to scripts.

WHAT IT MUST GET RIGHT, and most of it is the false positives:

  1. QUOTES ARE NOT REDIRECTIONS. `git commit -m "a > b"` contains a `>` that is
     not a redirect. Tokenising properly instead of regexing raw text is the
     whole difference, and case 'quoted' below is the one that would otherwise
     make this gate fire on ordinary commits until somebody disabled it.
  2. 2>&1 AND /dev/null ARE NOT FILES. They appear in a large share of all
     commands ever run here.
  3. READS ARE NOT WRITES. `cat` and `grep` against a vault file must pass, and
     so must a `python3 -c` that only opens a file to read it.
  4. THE RESIDUAL IS NAMED, NOT HIDDEN. Extraction cannot be complete against
     arbitrary shell — an interpreter this file does not know, a path built by
     string concatenation at runtime, a script invoked by name. The gate's
     docstring says so plainly rather than letting the next reader assume
     coverage it does not have.

Hermetic: builds a throwaway vault, a throwaway foreign repo, and drives the gate
as a subprocess exactly as the harness does.
