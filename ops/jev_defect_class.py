"""jev_defect_class.py — which existing defect class does a new defect belong to?

THE DAMAGE THIS EXISTS TO STOP, read live from the store on 2026-09-18:

    320 classes over 371 defects — 1.16 defects per class, 304 of them singletons.

A defect class earns its keep by counting. Three sessions making the same
mistake under three different class names is not three lessons, it is one
lesson recorded three times in a way that can never be noticed. The
record-defect verb already says so in its own schema text — "reuse an existing
class where one fits ... because the count per class is the entire point" —
and the numbers above are what that instruction achieves on its own. It asks a
session to compare a new defect against three hundred existing names, which is
work no session does, so every session invents a name and the ledger fragments.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES. It puts every existing class in front of ONE judgment as
the options of a single Choice question, and hands back the few worth reading.
It does not file anything and it does not pick.

THE FIRST VERSION ASKED ONE QUESTION PER CLASS, and that was a misreading of the
vendor's own guidance that cost 320 requests where one does better. "One request
per candidate, no request sees another" is the RERANKING rule, and it governs a
shortlist of thirty that a keyword search produced first. Choosing one item from
a roster is the other shape entirely: the vendor ranks 182 agent skills and
scores 218 document line identifiers in a single Choice. Measured here on the
same sixteen held-out defects, same corpus, same ground truth:

    one Noul per class ......... 320 requests  12.5s   38% top-1   81% top-8
    one Choice over the roster .   1 request    0.8s   69% top-1   88% top-8

Better on every axis. A second pass that re-scored the top eight with a Noul
each — the close look the vendor's skill-selection cookbook takes — was measured
too and made it WORSE, 56% top-1 against the Choice's own 69%, so it is not
here. The ranking pass is the answer.

WHY IT STILL RETURNS A SHORTLIST AND NEVER A PICK. 69% is much better than 38%
and it is still not something to file a record on unattended. The remaining
value is in reading eight names instead of three hundred, and that is what this
returns. The none-of-these probability comes back beside them, so a reader can
see when the judgment thinks this defect is genuinely new.

THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT OPTIONAL, each measured rather than assumed:

  · THE FREE LEXICAL TRIM. A Choice carries at most 255 options and there are
    320 classes. Splitting into two Choices is a measurement error, not a
    workaround: probabilities sum to one WITHIN a request, so numbers from two
    of them cannot be compared, and pooling them scored 75% top-8 against 88%
    for a single clean request. A token-overlap trim to 254 costs nothing, runs
    offline, and kept the true class in all sixteen held-out cases.

  · TRUNCATED RUBRICS IN THE RANKING PASS. 254 options carrying a full anchor
    defect each returns HTTP 400 max_tokens_exceeded. The cure is the vendor's
    own: rank on short index text, keep the full text for a closer look.

  · ONE ANCHOR, NOT THREE, AND NEVER THE BARE NAME. Measured separately on the
    same data, changing only how a class was described: the name alone ranked
    the true class 99th, the name with one earlier defect ranked it 1st, and the
    name with three illustrations ranked it 11th. Extra examples pull the
    category toward their own specifics and bury the name that defines it.

IT IS A LIBRARY AND MUST STAY ONE. No shebang and no main guard: either turns a
.py file into a registered script entrypoint in the sealed source inventory,
moves the frontier and owes a forward-only registry successor. The detector is
a regex over the whole file with no notion of docstrings, so the construct is
described here and never spelled. ops/typesafe_client.py carries the long form.
