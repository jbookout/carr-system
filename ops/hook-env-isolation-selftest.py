"""Proves a temp-repo git call is NOT hijacked by an inherited hook environment.

WHY THIS EXISTS — the bug it pins destroyed local main on 2026-08-14.

Git exports GIT_DIR (and usually GIT_INDEX_FILE) into every hook it runs. Those
variables OVERRIDE cwd for any child `git` process. ops/githooks/pre-push ran
ops/ci.sh directly, so CI inherited them, and every selftest that builds a
throwaway repository with tempfile.mkdtemp and calls git with cwd=<temp> was
silently operating on the LIVE repository instead.

The damage, found by a peer session: local main sitting on a commit whose tree held
THREE files, six commits ahead of origin, five of them selftest artifacts named
"seed", "seed unrelated" and one stamped +deadbeef, with all 818 paths staged as
additions — so any commit from any session would have swept the whole repository
under one message. Origin was never touched. Recovery was a mixed reset.

THE SELFTESTS WERE NEVER WRONG. The environment they inherited was. That is why the
fix is in the hook and not in the tests, and why this file asserts the property at
the environment level rather than re-checking anyone's sandboxing.
