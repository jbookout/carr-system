"""cutover-readiness.py — is <partner> actually ready to boot from the store?

WHY THIS EXISTS (Phase 1, 2026-08-13, the August 21 cutover). The cutover moves
Dell's BOOT PATH from the generated compiled-rules markdown files to the
store's standing-context verb. Proving that is safe was, until this script,
a manual ritual someone had to remember to run and eyeball — and the record
layer's own house rule is that a manual check nobody runs is not a check
(rules-live-check.py's whole reason for existing is the same lesson one layer
up: three green manual signals and a rule that bound nobody). This makes the
readiness question a PREDICATE: read-only, no arguments, deterministic,
wired into the nightly chain so drift shows up before the 21st rather than on
it.

WHAT "READY" MEANS, per partner, four things all agreeing:
  1. A LIVE standing-context call (through the same local path a real session
     boots through — tools/call-verb.py -> mcp-server/local-verb.mjs) returns
     rule counts.
  2. Those counts match an INDEPENDENT query against the store's own active-
     rule view (exporters.targets._fetch_rules — the exporter's own fetch, not
     a second reimplementation of it; same reasoning as rules-live-check.py:
     a second query is a second contract, and the two would drift exactly the
     way the doc and the export drifted to produce the 2026-08-04 defect).
  3. The partner's compiled-rules RENDER (the fallback file DELL boots from
     until 2026-08-21, and JOE's emergency fallback after) declares a count
     that also agrees. Disagreement here means the fallback is stale and
     would mislead if the store were ever unreachable.
  4. DOCTRINE is reachable through the same local path (doctrine-index).

THE ONE THING THIS SCRIPT CANNOT DO: prove #1 and #4 for a partner who is not
THIS machine. Phase 1 closed the caller-supplied-identity hole on purpose
(mcp-server/local-verb.mjs, 2026-08-13) — there is no argv slug anymore, and
there must not be, because faking one here would be reopening the exact hole
that change closed for the sake of a health check. Identity is derived from
~/.config/carr/local-actor.json, written once per machine by
bin/set-local-actor.sh, so on Joe's Mac this can only ever prove #1/#4 for
"joe"; run it on Dell's Mac and it proves them for "dell". Checks #2 and #3
are store/file facts with no identity in them, so they run for BOTH partners
from either machine — that half of the predicate is never partial.

A partner who cannot be live-checked from this machine is reported
PARTIAL-HERE, not READY and not NOT READY: nothing failed, something merely
was not asked. PARTIAL-HERE does not fail the exit code. An actual
disagreement anywhere (store vs render, live call vs store, doctrine
unreachable, store unreachable) is NOT READY and does fail it.

Writes out/cutover-readiness.json (the delegate-pattern artifact
tools/health-check.py reads, same shape as rules-live-check's stdout but
structured for a second reader) and prints the same verdict as text.

  ./.venv/bin/python ops/cutover-readiness.py

Exit 0 = every partner is READY or PARTIAL-HERE (nothing checkable failed).
Exit 2 = at least one partner has an actual disagreement or an unreachable
         store/verb — see the printed finding for which.
