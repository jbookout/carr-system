"""Acceptance test for migration 0225's fabricated-drill-row guard.

WHAT IT DEFENDS. ops/ci.sh globs ops/*-selftest.py, so the key-recovery
selftest runs on any ordinary sweep. In a worktree whose base predates the
PR #340 credential belts, that selftest still reaches the production ledger,
because tools/ops-record.py's own _load_db_env() re-supplies the real jobs DSN
for any credential name the caller left unset. A guard in any file on main
cannot help there — a stale checkout runs its own copy of every file. So the
refusal lives in the database, and this test states what it must and must not
refuse.

TIER 1 (always runs; no database, no credential): the predicate in the
migration is read as text and checked against the rows it must reject and the
rows it must never reject. The second half is the point. The one-time August
purge also matched "paper-copy key%" whenever detail did not name a carr-202608
dump; that pairing was correct for one afternoon and is wrong forever, because a
genuine September key-recovery row satisfies both halves. A permanent guard
carrying that clause would silently delete real backup-failure history.

This test never opens a connection, so it cannot itself become the thing it is
testing for.
