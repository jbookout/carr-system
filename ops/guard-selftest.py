"""guard-selftest.py — prove the egress guard actually denies what it claims to.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT SHELLS OUT. On 2026-08-09 a session "verified"
a KNOWN_HOSTS widening by importing the guard and calling its matcher directly.
Every case passed. The gate was not running at all — a plugin install had deleted
the hooks block from ~/.claude/settings.json the day before, and the session's
own WebFetch calls were sailing through unguarded while its test reported green.

The lesson (rules a9ecd5b4, fa217e48): a success signal must come from the
ARTIFACT, and the artifact here is the hook as the harness invokes it — a process
fed JSON on stdin whose EXIT CODE decides. So every case below spawns the real
file. Importing it would re-run the same mistake in a nicer wrapper.

    ops/guard-selftest.py           # run every case, exit 1 on any failure
    ops/guard-selftest.py -v        # print each case

NOTE ON SCOPE: this proves the guard's LOGIC. It cannot prove the guard is
REGISTERED — that is ops/config-as-code.py check, which compares the live
settings against the repo baseline. Both are needed and neither substitutes for
the other. That division is the whole lesson of the incident above.

# a branch going stale mid-review is the normal case, not the exception. The fix
# for a stale branch is `git rebase origin/main` followed by a force-push to the
# SAME branch — but the blanket "force push" rule refused that, so the only route
# left was: abandon the branch, cut a new one, open a second pull request. Four
# closed pull requests say so in their own closing notes, verbatim — "reopened on
# a fresh branch because rewriting the pushed one needs a force-push, which the
# unattended guard blocks" (#125, #131, #142, and #100 in the same words).
#
# Every one of those events leaves a PERMANENT orphan, because GitHub's
# auto-delete fires on MERGE and never on close. 25 closed pull requests and 35
# dead branches were swept by hand on 2026-08-15; the guard was manufacturing the
# garbage it was never asked to make.

# This session has no access to that transcript corpus (it is not attached

# hold), so it cannot replay the same 12,145 commands byte-for-byte. What
# follows is a representative sample of the ordinary command shapes this

# diff, ops/*.py invocations, npm/node test runs, cd+ls, curl to an
# allowlisted host — asserted ALLOWED, as a standing regression net for the
# next redesign rather than a claim of having replayed the reviewer's exact
