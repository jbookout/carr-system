"""blocker-review-selftest.py — fixtures for ops/blocker-review.py.

WHY THIS EXISTS. blocker-review.py is the tool the loop-drain task is told to
use — "already exists and reports what has genuinely unblocked; use it, do not
rebuild it." On 2026-08-21 it did not report anything at all: it died with
`psycopg.errors.InsufficientPrivilege: permission denied for table activity`
before printing a single line. The counterparty test joins four base tables
(activity, activity_kind, party, and the client/lead/vendor union) and the
credential it runs under — app_exporter_local — can read NONE of them. Measured
the same day: has_table_privilege says loop_item=True, activity=False,
activity_kind=False, party=False, client=False, lead=False, vendor=False. The
exporter is deliberately view-scoped (79 of 79 views readable, zero base
tables), so that branch could never have run under it.

A crash is the loud failure. The quiet one is worse and is also fixed here: the
module docstring promised FOUR clearable classes and the code implemented three,
with `capability` falling through to a bare `unknown += 1`. That is the same
shape as the gate-edit-gate defect of 2026-08-10 — "a docstring asserted the
coverage, so the gap read as closed."

These tests are pure: no database, no network. That is the point — the classifier
logic is the part that was wrong, and it should be provable without the
credential whose absence started this.
