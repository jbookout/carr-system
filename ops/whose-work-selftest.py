"""ops/whose-work-selftest.py — acceptance test for bin/whose-work.py.

WHAT IT IS FOR. Rule 173119a8 binds at the moment a session is about to say
anything about uncommitted work, a dirty tree, or who is blocking whom: measure
against origin/<branch>, never against HEAD, and read the SIGN. Its own incident
was a session naming another session as the blocker off a HEAD-based diff — the
diff was accurate and the conclusion was backwards, because a local HEAD that is
BEHIND origin makes someone else's landed work look like your missing work.

Several sessions share one checkout here, so the question "is this mine, and is
it landed" comes up constantly and was answered by hand every time.

TESTS AGAINST REAL REPOSITORIES, never mocks: a bare remote plus working clones
in a temp dir, so ahead/behind/diverged are produced by git rather than asserted
about git. No network.

THE SIGN IS THE POINT. Ahead and behind are not symmetric and must never be
collapsed into one "out of sync" count: ahead means work that exists nowhere
else, behind means work someone else already landed. Confusing them is the
original incident.
