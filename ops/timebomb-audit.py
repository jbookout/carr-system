"""ops/timebomb-audit.py -- weekly scripted time-bomb audit (launchd, not a
scheduled model session).

WHAT A TIME BOMB IS, for this file. Code that is correct today and will
break, or silently change behaviour, with NO code change: purely because
time passes, or because the repo, a database, a log, or a counter grows.
Not every hardcoded number or date is one -- most are intentional and safe
(a page size, a display truncation, a schema column type nowhere near its
range) -- which is why this pipeline has three layers rather than one:

  1. CHEAP DETERMINISTIC SIGNATURES (scan_repo below) -- regex regions over
     tracked source, ported from the one-off scan that started this file
     (scratchpad/timebomb/find_candidates.py, 2026-09-24): git history
     windows, hardcoded dates compared against "now", expiry/deadline
     fields, exact counts pinned to growth, unbounded LIMITs, append-only
     logs, fixed-width migration numbers. Deliberately ambiguous -- each
     signature also matches the safe case, which is what leaves anything
     for Jev or deterministic headroom to judge.

  2. DETERMINISTIC HEADROOM (compute_headroom) -- for the two signature
     families where "how close is this to tripping" is computable without
     asking a model: a git history window (git rev-list gives the real
     commit velocity) and a literal date (compared against today). A
     computed headroom under HEADROOM_COMMIT_THRESHOLD commits or
     HEADROOM_DAYS_THRESHOLD days is a finding REGARDLESS of what Jev says
     about it -- Jev only ranks where to look, it never overrides a
     deterministic clock or counter.

  3. JEV JUDGMENT (judge_regions) -- ops/typesafe_client.py's ask(), asking
     three questions per region in ONE request (breaks_without_code_change,
     fails_silently, horizon), the same shape as the one-off scan
     (scratchpad/timebomb/scan.py) and reusing ops/jev_code_review.py's
     answer_value() reader UNCHANGED -- that reader shipped a real bug once
     (read body["probability"], which does not exist, and scored 426
     regions 0.0 -- see answer_value()'s own docstring) and the only reason
     it was caught was running it against a known-bad and a known-good
     snippet first. This file repeats that check -- reader_sanity_check()
     below -- at the START of every real run, and a run where it fails, or
     where Jev is unreachable, or where zero regions get judged despite
     there being some to judge, FAILS LOUDLY (nonzero exit, a line that
     says exactly that) rather than ever reporting "0 new findings" for a
     reason that has nothing to do with there being no findings.

THE TRIAGE LEDGER (ops/config/timebomb-triage.v1.json) is what keeps this
weekly and not a one-off: a region is keyed by its path plus a hash of its
own (whitespace-normalised) code text, so a REVIEWED region stays suppressed
across runs, and a region whose surrounding code CHANGES gets a fresh hash
and is treated as new. The ledger is seeded with the 15 false positives the
2026-09-24 one-off scan found (one-shot applied migrations, intentional
markers, synthetic test NOWs, expiries that are read from config and raise
loudly, and so on) -- see ops/config/timebomb-triage.v1.json's own entries
for the reasons. Already-applied migrations are excluded from the scan
STRUCTURALLY (MIGRATIONS_DIR below) rather than merely ledgered, because a
migrations/*.sql file that has already been applied to production never
re-runs -- there is no "grows and breaks" story to tell about it at all.

RECORD-LAYER FILING follows the SAME call path tools/cutover-watch.py (the
launchd-run cutover watch, invoked hourly-scale through
bin/run-scheduled.sh) already uses to reach a verb from an unattended
script: a subprocess call to `run.sh call <verb> '<json>'`, never the
generic MCP call-verb passthrough tool (see CLAUDE.md's fallback-door
doctrine). A clean run (nothing new since the ledger) stays silent and
writes nothing to the record; a run with new findings files exactly ONE
record-defect summarising them (never one per region -- the defect log
wants classes and counts, not a row flood) and, in the same run, posts ONE
`@queue enqueue` turn to the partner room's Hermes queue asking a session
with repo-write to work the findings (see queue_enqueue_turn() below for
why `./run.sh call add-room-turn` is the one scripted path that can produce
an accepted origin for that queue command).

USAGE:
  ops/timebomb-audit.py                  # real run: scan, judge, file, report
  ops/timebomb-audit.py --dry-run        # scan and judge, write the local
                                          # report, but file nothing to the
                                          # record layer or the room queue
  ops/timebomb-audit.py --no-jev         # deterministic-only pass (selftest
                                          # / offline use); still requires
                                          # the reader check to be skipped
                                          # explicitly, since there is no
                                          # reader to sanity-check

If the LaunchAgent is missing on a machine (a fresh clone, or after the job
has been unloaded), install it with the exact sed / plutil / launchctl
sequence in ops/launchd/com.carr.timebomb-audit.plist's own header comment.
There is deliberately no bin/install-timebomb-audit.sh: a bin/install-*.sh is
an external-admin ingress that would need its own SCAC registry successor
(see com.carr.release-pipeline.plist's header for the same reasoning), and
installing a weekly audit job is a small enough act that the three commands
belong inline rather than behind a script. This is deliberately not
`ops/config-as-code.py install --apply` either (the broad reconciler, which
has no per-job filter and would also rewrite every other hook and
LaunchAgent).

Env overrides (test isolation, same convention as CARR_REPLAY_REPO):
  CARR_TIMEBOMB_REPO           repo root to scan (default: this file's
                                grandparent directory)
  CARR_TIMEBOMB_OUT_DIR        where the local JSON report is written
                                (default: <repo>/out/timebomb-audit)
  CARR_TIMEBOMB_TRIAGE_PATH    the triage ledger path (default:
                                <repo>/ops/config/timebomb-triage.v1.json)

# ── ROOM QUEUE: WORK THE FINDINGS ────────────────────────────────────────
# Joe's 2026-09-24 scope addition: a clean run stays silent; a run with new
# findings also enqueues a repo-write Claude Desktop session through the
# partner room's Hermes queue, so the findings get worked without anyone
# having to notice the defect row and start a session by hand.
#
# `add-room-turn`'s own handler (mcp-server/src/partner-room.js) ALWAYS
# stamps `origin_channel: "mcp", origin_actor: actor.slug` server-side for
# every caller whose credential resolves to a sponsored partner (any
# credential add-room-turn already accepts at all) -- it is not something a
# caller can spoof or omit, and it is not conditional on the call coming
# from an interactive session. `run.sh call add-room-turn` (the exact door
# tools/cutover-watch.py already uses from an unattended launchd script for
# update-loop) authenticates as this Mac's local machine token, which
# resolves to a sponsored partner the same way that existing call does --
# so it produces a turn with origin_channel="mcp" and a non-empty
# origin_actor, which is exactly what tools/room-bridge/queue_grammar.py's
# _origin() requires to accept an `@queue enqueue` command. No forged
# origin is needed or attempted here: the server derives it, this script
# only supplies the room turn's body text.
