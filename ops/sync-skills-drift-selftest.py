"""ops/sync-skills-drift-selftest.py — the acceptance test for bin/sync-skills.sh's
drift report, and specifically for the half of it that used to be invisible.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (2026-08-21, defect class
`warning-surface-blind-to-the-direction-that-destroys-data`). The report built
its list from `rsync -rcn --delete --out-format='%n'`, which emits the paths the
apply would ADD and says nothing about the paths it would DELETE. The apply is
`rsync -rc --delete`, an exact mirror, so a file that existed only on the Drive
side was removed without ever appearing in the report that exists to warn you
first. It happened for real: the `surface-review` skill, hand-authored on Drive
2026-08-13, sat unmentioned in every drift listing for eight days and was one
`--apply` away from deletion. The script's closing advice — "if the repo side is
right (it should be, it is canon): ./bin/sync-skills.sh --apply" — read as safe
while it was not.

A drift report that is silent about deletion is worse than no report, because it
is consulted and believed.

NO MOCK. This drives the REAL bin/sync-skills.sh as a subprocess against a pair
of throwaway trees, using the CARR_SKILLS_DST seam the fix adds for exactly this
purpose. Nothing here touches the live Drive projection: every case builds its
own source and destination under a temporary directory and the destination path
is asserted to be inside it before the script is ever invoked.
