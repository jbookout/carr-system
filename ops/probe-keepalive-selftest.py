"""ops/probe-keepalive-selftest.py — prove the probe can say DOWN.

A liveness probe run against three healthy servers agrees that everything is
fine, and would agree just as readily if `port_accepts` returned True
unconditionally, if the PID parse silently produced None-means-up, or if the
whole verdict were hardcoded. That is the same trap ops/edge-liveness.py fell
into on its first green run, and the answer is the same: exercise the failure
paths deliberately.

NO MOCKS, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. These checks use REAL sockets and REAL
processes:
  * a real listening socket on an ephemeral port, to prove `accepting` is true
    when something is genuinely accepting;
  * that same socket CLOSED, to prove it goes false — the closed case is the one
    that matters and the one a mock would have gotten wrong;
  * a real child process, to prove process liveness reads true;
  * that same process KILLED, to prove it reads false.
A test-only seam would have proven that the seam works. On 2026-08-14 the
settings gate shipped two defects and both were "a test that exercised a path
production never takes" (team loop T75), so this file takes the long way round.

WHAT IS NOT COVERED HERE, said plainly: `launchd_pid` is exercised against real
launchd labels only through the live run recorded in the pull request, because
this suite cannot create a launchd agent without installing one. The pure
socket and process logic is owned here; the launchctl parse is owned by that run.
