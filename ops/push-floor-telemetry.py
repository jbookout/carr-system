"""push-floor-telemetry.py — the confirm-or-kill number for the 2026-08-23
push-path change.

WHAT WAS DECIDED AND WHAT IS BEING MEASURED. That day's gates council moved the
full ten-class ops/ci.sh off ops/githooks/pre-push, leaving a fast local floor
(pushfloor, secret) and keeping the full strict suite hosted as the required
merge check. Both chairs marked it a COST trade rather than a defect fix, and
attached one acceptance test to it:

    count, over the first week, the hosted-red runs that the old local-full
    push would have caught before the push left the machine.

That count is the verdict. Near zero means the local minutes were sediment and
the change stands. Materially non-zero means local-full was doing real work,
and the honest response is to put some of those classes back on the push path
-- not to argue about it.

HOW IT IS COUNTED, and why not by re-running anything. ops/ci.sh emits one
`ci-floor-verdict:` line on every red run, naming the failed classes split into
`floor:` (the local hook still runs these, so a failure means the floor let
something past) and `relocated:` (used to be caught locally, now hosted-only).
This reads those lines back out of the hosted job logs. Nothing is recomputed
and nothing is inferred: the run that had the facts wrote them down.

    ops/push-floor-telemetry.py                # the last 7 days
    ops/push-floor-telemetry.py --days 14
    ops/push-floor-telemetry.py --json

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IS GUESS. Runs older than the change have no verdict line,
and are reported as `unclassified` rather than as zero -- an absent measurement
and a measurement of zero are different findings (rule 88e9b5eb). Likewise, if
`gh` is missing or unauthenticated this exits 78 (EX_CONFIG, the repo's "not
configured here"), never 0 with an empty count.
