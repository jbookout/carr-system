"""Rollback-only real-PostgreSQL acceptance for the server-side Jev call log
(migration 0587: ops.jev_call_receipt, its write door
ops.record_jev_call_receipt, its read door ops.read_jev_call_receipts and its
integrity audit ops.jev_call_receipt_integrity).

WHY THIS EXISTS. mcp-server/test/jev-call-receipt.test.mjs exercises the verb
handlers against a JS fake of the doors. A fake cannot catch what only a real
catalog exposes (migration 0580's unqualified digest() under a pinned
search_path shipped exactly that way), and it cannot prove the properties the
Jev gates lean on. The store is DETECTABLE, NOT PREVENTED against its owner
(see the migration header); this gate proves the detection half:

  1. The write door works for carr_writer, stamps recorded_at from the server
     clock and records the server-derived actor (a slug that does not match
     the actor id is refused).
  2. The read door credits a receipt only when public.tool_call holds the
     matching ask-jev row (same key, verb, actor, and receipt_id in the
     stored response); a receipt inserted with no tool_call row is not
     returned, and neither is another actor's receipt.
  3. The read door returns the OLDEST `limit` rows from `since`, oldest
     first, with truncated=true when more exist.
  4. The integrity audit flags the uncredited receipt and reports the
     append-only triggers enabled, then reports them disabled after an owner
     disables one.
  5. No app role can touch the table directly; UPDATE and DELETE are refused
     by trigger even for the owner; prompt_sha256 is required exactly when
     purpose = 'build_advisory', at the door and by the table CHECK.
