"""ops/glanceable-lead-selftest.py — acceptance test for ops/glanceable-lead-check.py.

THE RULE (17ffd587, Joe, Jul 15/16 2026): never surface "call this lead / follow
up" on open-loops, the heartbeat, or the Monday brief. Leads live on The Lead
Board and Joe works them there. CARVE-OUT, in the rule's own words: a follow-up
DATE Joe sets on a real DEAL is the reminder system working — surface it.

WHY IT NEEDS A CHECK. The rule governs what reaches Joe's daily surfaces, and
those surfaces are GENERATED. Nothing stops a lead-outreach row being written
into a loop and rendering onto the hot list the next morning; the rule has held
so far because sessions remembered it, which is the failure mode rule ab814a26
names.

WHAT COUNTS AS A VIOLATION, and the narrowness is the design: a lead reference
sitting in an OUTREACH instruction. "Send Dr. X (L-221) the advisory" is the
shape the rule forbids. A lead reference doing bookkeeping — "Registry L-004
stamp owed to the next writer" — is not an outreach reminder and must not be
flagged, or the check starts crying about its own record-keeping.

THE HOT LIST IS GLANCEABLE; THE BACKLOG IS NOT. open-loops.md is always-read.
open-loops-backlog.md says in its own header that it is read on cadence, not
every session, which is where a dormant lead item is allowed to live.
