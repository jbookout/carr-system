"""Enumerate the exact sibling paths a build seat may read, for its brief.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every A03 packet forbids scoping a command at the shared
program directory. Every builder nonetheless has to find its sibling
artifacts, and the packet offers no permitted way to do that — so on
2026-09-02 the prohibition was broken three times in one round, by two
builders and by the controller setting the round up (defect b7936d5d). Three
occurrences of one shape is the instruction failing, not three careless
seats, and the outgoing controller's handoff had already named the remedy:
"the fix is a positive instruction, not another prohibition."

This is that positive instruction. THE CONTROLLER runs it before dispatch and
pastes the output into the brief, so the seat is handed the exact paths and
never needs to look. One sanctioned listing by the party who owns the
directory replaces one ad-hoc listing per seat.

    ops/doctorcre-sibling-manifest.py <seed>        e.g. a03a

Prints a brief-ready block: the seed's own prior-revision bundle file by file,
the upstream walkthrough bundles it is entitled to, and its packet. It does
NOT decide what the packet admits — it lists what exists, by exact path, and
the packet's Field 7 still governs which of them must be opened.
