"""Compile the enforcement control catalog from the repository's own map.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `approve-rule` refuses unless every control a rule names is
registered in ops.enforcement_control_catalog and verified. Registration was a
hand-written production migration per control. So on 2026-08-22 the repository's
enforcement map described 59 controls and the database catalog held THREE —
and approving any rule enforced by the other 56 meant writing and shipping a
migration first. That is the red tape: not the requirement that a rule be
enforced before it binds, which is right and stays, but the ceremony of
restating in SQL something the repository already declares.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT RELAXED. The trust boundary is unchanged. A control could
only ever be registered by a merged, reviewed repository change; a migration was
one such change and the map is another. What is removed is the second
transcription, which could drift from the first and did.

VERIFIED MEANS SOMETHING HERE. The catalog's own constraint refuses an installed
row with no verified_at, so this refuses to mark a control installed unless:

  * every implementation path it names exists and is tracked by git, and
  * every test path it names exists and is tracked by git, and
  * at least one of those tests is one CI ACTUALLY RUNS — ops/*-selftest.py,
    which ops/ci.sh's gates class executes by glob on every push with zero
    quarantined entries, or a node test under mcp-server/test/.

That last condition is the one that matters. A control whose test nothing runs
is a control with no enforcement point, and rule ab814a26 is explicit that
recitation is not enforcement. Such a control is still written to the catalog —
hiding it would be worse — but as installed=false with no verified_at, so
approve-rule refuses it and says why.

DETERMINISTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. No model, no judgment, no network: a pure
function of two files on disk plus `git ls-files`. It is the compiled-check
shape the control-plane architecture contract asks for.
