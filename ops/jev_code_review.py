"""Read the codebase for slop and for bugs, with a judgment instead of a grep.

WHY A JUDGMENT AND NOT MORE PATTERNS. Every signature worth scanning for here
is ambiguous at the pattern level, and the ambiguity is the whole problem. A
hook that catches every exception and returns is CORRECT — a gate that raises
wedges the session, so failing open is the design. The same three lines in a
data path are a failure nobody will ever see. 205 of them are in this tree and
a grep cannot tell you which kind it found. Neither can a rule that says "avoid
bare excepts"; it gets suppressed everywhere and stops meaning anything.

THE SHAPE, and it is the documented one rather than the obvious one. A cheap
deterministic pass finds CANDIDATE REGIONS. Only then does a judgment read
them, and it reads each region ONCE with every question asked together, since
independent questions about one subject belong in a single request — measured
by the vendor at 12.2x cheaper than asking them one at a time, and each
question is still scored on its own against the state.

QUESTIONS ARE NARROW ON PURPOSE. "Is this slop?" is a broad question hiding
several judgments, which is the documented mistake. Each question below decides
one thing, states its own criteria, and carries its full meaning in its text —
the ids are for this module and are never sent.

NOTHING HERE DECIDES ANYTHING. It produces a reading list ordered by
probability. A finding is a place to look, and the removal is a person's call
made against the code, because the cost of deleting a live failure path is
far higher than the cost of reading a false positive.
