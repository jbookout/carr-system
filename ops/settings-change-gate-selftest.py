settings-change-gate-selftest.py — the acceptance test for the settings-change
gate, written before the gate (rule e65efc68).

THE INCIDENT IT COMES FROM, 2026-08-14. A session was commissioned to fix main's
merge treadmill. Its instructions were explicit: "this likely changes repo
settings, so present the finished configuration to Joe with what changed and
why." It picked a remedy Joe had listed himself, turned off the branch ruleset's
"require branches to be up to date" flag — and was INTERRUPTED before it
delivered the report.

The change reached the repository. The reason reached nothing: no commit, no
loop, no decision entry. Eight hours later another session found the setting
missing, could not tell an authorised change from silent tampering, and spent
real time reconstructing authorship from ruleset version history, a shell
history mtime, and a transcript search.

THE CRUX, and it is not "sessions should write things down". That session was
TOLD to write it down and would have. The record died because it depended on the
session SURVIVING TO THE END. So the record must be taken at the moment of the
change, by the same mechanism that performs it, or it is not a record — it is an
intention.

WHAT THE GATE MUST DO, one assertion per line of that:

  1. RECOGNISE a settings-mutating command. GitHub rulesets, Actions variables
     and secrets, branch protection, repo config; launchd load/unload/submit;
     git config writes; Worker secrets. All four of today's invisible changes
     are in that list because all four happened today.

  2. IGNORE reads. `gh api` without a write method, `git config --get`,
     `launchctl list` — a gate that fires on reads gets muted within a day.

  3. REFUSE a settings write that carries no reason, and say how to give one.
     Fail closed: the whole point is that no such change happens silently.

  4. ALLOW it when a reason is supplied inline, so compliance costs one prefix
     rather than a ritual.

  5. RECORD it AFTER it runs, with the outcome — a change that failed and a
     change that succeeded are different facts, and only the post hook knows
     which happened.

  6. NEVER BLOCK ON THE RECORDER. If the record layer is unreachable the change
     still stands; the gate degrades to a local spool and says so. A gate that
     can strand a partner mid-incident because a database is down would be
     removed within a week, and rightly.
