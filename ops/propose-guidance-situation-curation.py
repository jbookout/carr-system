"""Propose the reviewed situation curation the Guidance Registry is waiting on.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-23). The typed Guidance Registry has been built,
migrated, gated and tested, and it has never held a single item. Its activation
function refuses for two stated reasons, and only one of them was ever the real
blocker:

    constitution      between 5 and 10 active items   — 5 candidates are reviewed
    coverage          zero failures                    — 204 on 2026-08-23

Coverage is 204 because the registry is empty, and it is empty because the
import refuses: every one of the 13 reviewed DOCTRINE guidance records needs an
approved WR-AI-006 situation bridge, and production carries one approved concept
of the thirteen. ops/guidance-situation-curation-preflight.py names each missing
one exactly. Nothing had ever proposed them, so the whole machine sat waiting on
a step nobody had been asked to take — the dormant-machine failure this work was
told not to repeat.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads audits/guidance-situation-curation-review.v1.json — the
REVIEWED curation package, already covering all 13 doctrine records — and fires
the machine-callable half of the curation path for everything production is
missing: propose-retrieval-concept, propose-retrieval-phrase and
propose-retrieval-mapping. Every field comes from the reviewed file; this script
invents nothing, and refuses rather than guessing when a row is incomplete.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, by design. approve-retrieval-proposals is human-only and
atomic: it promotes the batch, re-runs the golden retrieval suite, and rolls the
whole batch back on any regression. So this leaves ONE approval for Joe instead
of thirty-nine decisions, which is the shape rule 14e0408b asks for.

    ops/propose-guidance-situation-curation.py            # dry run: what is missing
    ops/propose-guidance-situation-curation.py --apply    # fire the proposals
    ops/propose-guidance-situation-curation.py --pending  # the exact approval call
