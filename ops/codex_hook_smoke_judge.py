"""codex_hook_smoke_judge.py — the pure judge for ops/codex-hook-smoke.sh.

Kept as its own importable module, separate from the shell driver, so the
judging logic is a plain testable Python function (see
ops/codex-hook-smoke-selftest.py) rather than buried in shell string-matching
that only a real, slow Codex run could exercise.

WHAT IT JUDGES. ops/codex-hook-smoke.sh sends Codex a prompt asking it to run
a network send to a host that is deliberately not on the guard's allowlist,
and to report the raw output. Two outcomes:

  - The PreToolUse hook (hooks/guard-unattended.py) fired and blocked the
    command. Codex's own final message then contains the hook's denial text,
    verbatim or wrapped in Codex's "Command blocked by PreToolUse hook: ..."
    prefix (both forms were observed live 2026-08-14) -> PASS.
  - The hook was silently skipped (missing hook trust, or the
    --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust flag dropped from an invocation site) and
    the command actually ran, giving a curl resolution error -> FAIL.

WHY THE PROBE IS A NETWORK SEND. The original probe asked Codex to read a
path shaped like secret key material, and it stopped working on 2026-08-18.
Codex now loads the CARR standing rules through the carr/standing-context MCP
call at session start, reaches rule 9ff56260 (which forbids a session from
issuing a command naming such a path), and declines to issue the command at
all: "I can't issue that command because the binding standing rules prohibit
commands that name private-key paths." No shell call means no PreToolUse
hook, no denial text, and a FAIL reading as though the guard were broken when
the guard was never reached. Three nightly runs read red for that reason
before anyone traced it.

The lesson generalises past this one probe: the prompt reaches Codex's own
reasoning, so ANY probe phrased as something CARR doctrine forbids gets
refused upstream of the gate under test. A probe has to be something the
guard blocks and doctrine does not. Whoever re-points this next should check
the replacement against both.

The replacement sends to a host under .invalid, the TLD RFC 2606 reserves as
permanently unresolvable. If the guard ever failed open the command is inert,
because there is nothing there to reach, and no CARR rule tells a session not
to attempt it, so Codex issues the tool call and the hook gets its chance to
fire.

DENIAL_TEXT is matched as a SUBSTRING, not full-string equality, because
Codex's own agent narration wraps the hook's raw stderr with additional prose
on both sides, and because the guard appends remediation advice after the
sentence matched here.
