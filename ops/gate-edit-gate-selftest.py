"""gate-edit-gate-selftest.py — fixtures for the gate-protection layer, BOTH doors.

Spawns the REAL hooks with REAL payloads and reads what they actually do.

THREE VERDICTS, NOT TWO — and the third is the whole point of this rewrite.
Before 2026-08-10 this file asserted DENY on every enforcement file. Joe
downgraded the gate to announce-and-allow that morning (decision bd30b665) and
the fixtures were never moved, so the suite sat at 15/27 with all twelve
protection cases red. A suite that is chronically red detects nothing — it is
the identical failure this system already ate on 2026-08-08, when a stale
baseline made a real five-gate wipe print the same headline as a benign drift.

So "allow" alone is no longer a passing answer for a protected file. ANNOUNCE
means allowed AND the session was told, in the tool result, that enforcement
just changed. If someone deletes the announce block, the call still succeeds and
the old style of test would still pass — this one goes red, which is correct,
because a silent gate edit is exactly the thing loop #231 was opened about.

    ANNOUNCE  exit 0 + the announcement on stdout   (protected file)
    ALLOW     exit 0, silent                        (ordinary work)
    DENY      exit 2                                (nothing here should)

BOTH DOORS ARE COVERED HERE. The Write/Edit door is gate-edit-gate.py; the Bash
door is guard-unattended.py, added 2026-08-10 after the shell path was proven
open — append, `sed -i`, `>` onto settings.json and tee onto a gate all returned
a silent ALLOW, while gate-edit-gate.py's own docstring had claimed since
2026-08-09 that guard-unattended.py covered them. Both doors read one list
(hooks/gate_paths.py), so a fixture that passes on one and fails on the other is
reporting real drift rather than a fixture bug.

THE ALLOW HALF IS STILL THE IMPORTANT HALF. These gates sit in front of the
most-used tools in the system. If they announce on ordinary work the noise makes
them worth ignoring, which is the same outcome as never building them. Every
normal file must come back silent.

THE SELFTEST EXEMPTION IS TESTED EXPLICITLY. Fixtures prove a gate change; they
are not the gate. If gating them ever creeps in, testing a gate becomes harder
than weakening one, which is backwards.

# ── door 1b: the gate-ADMISSION card (2026-08-23) ────────────────────────────
# THE MISSING GATE THE GATES AUDIT NAMED (Grok's M6, high confidence): gate-edit
# re-blesses hashes; nothing asked whether a NEW blocker should exist at all.
# "This is the missing gate that prevents the next 59 from becoming 90."
#
# WHAT IT ASKS, and it is the council's own seven-part test compiled: parent
# incident or named landing harm, bind moment, consumer of the prevented
# artifact, self-serve remedy, scarce-resource cost, unique-bind claim, and a
# matcher test. No card, no new blocker. A LOG-ONLY matcher ships cheaper,
# deliberately — the point is to price blocking, not to price building.
#
# WHY THIS ONE DENIES when the gate around it only announces. Joe downgraded
# gate-edit to announce on 2026-08-10 (decision bd30b665) because it was
# blocking work HE HAD ASKED FOR, six times in two days — an approval channel
# that could not see his approval. That reasoning is about editing gates that
# already exist, which is constant. The birth of a new BLOCKER is rare, it is
# the event the audit was convened about, and its remedy is a JSON file the
# session writes itself with nobody's password: exactly the "wall he cannot
# open" objection, answered.
#
# GRANDFATHERED ON PURPOSE. Every blocker already in the baseline keeps its
# place without a card. A check that failed on day one over 40-odd existing
# gates would be muted on day one — the failure ops/enforcement-coverage-check.py
# documents at length and solved the same way.
