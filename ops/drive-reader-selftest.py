"""Control-plane check: records mode must not require retired Drive feeds.

The files remain a deliberate recovery surface until the Drive retirement gate
has accepted evidence.  This check protects the normal code path: choosing
records must read the canonical pool/views without first globbing a deprecated
file merely to render a label or feed a second writer.
