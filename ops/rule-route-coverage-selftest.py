"""rule-route-coverage-selftest.py — the paired suite for ops/rule-route-coverage.py.

Written before the check. Builds its own small corpus, class table, verb
registry and route file, proves the clean fixture passes, then plants one
mutant at a time and requires the check to KILL each one by name. The real
repository's route file is checked last, because that is the file that
actually decides what a session is shown.

Jev ranked the mutants for this gate (verification_selection, 2026-09-26; the
probability that a mutant is both realistic and silently costs recall): a
corpus rule the route file never mentions (0.86), an active rule with no route
(0.77), a trigger naming a verb the registry does not have (0.73), a duplicate
whose survivor has no delivery of its own (0.68), a tool the delivering hook is
never invoked for (0.67), a Stop-only class-d rule with no trigger in front of
it (0.67), rule text carried in the route file (0.58), an invalid bash regex
(0.54), an unknown tool (0.53), a missing gate file (0.51), an empty trigger
(0.51), and a stale id (0.39). The top six are the core; every one is planted
and must be killed.
