"""ops/key-recovery-test-selftest.py — the acceptance test for
bin/key-recovery-test.sh (Program 4's last unproven backup requirement).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. bin/restore-rehearse.sh proves a backup restores, but it
reads the age private key from ~/.config/carr/age-key.txt — never from the
OFFLINE PAPER copy that is the actual disaster-recovery path if this Mac dies.
That paper copy, written down and stored off the machine on 2026-08-02, had
never been exercised: if a transcription error sits in it, every backup is
unreadable and the way anyone finds out is the day it is needed.
bin/key-recovery-test.sh closes that gap in two phases — DECISIVE: does the
typed paper key's derived public key match backups-public-key.txt, without
ever printing either private key; REAL: on a match, hand the typed identity's
PATH (never its content) to the unmodified bin/restore-rehearse.sh and let its
own four production-write guards and its own teardown do the actual restoring.

NO MOCK, SAME DISCIPLINE AS ops/restore-rehearse-record-selftest.py. This
drives the REAL bin/key-recovery-test.sh as a real subprocess, generates a REAL
throwaway age keypair with the REAL age-keygen binary (never a stand-in), and
lets the script's own shape validation, its own `age-keygen -y` derivation, and
its own comparison all run for real. The ONE thing it cannot afford is a
terminal to type into and a real Neon branch — so it uses TWO test-only env
hooks, chained:

  CARR_KEY_RECOVERY_TEST_SELFTEST(_TYPED_KEY|_PUBKEY_FILE|_PAUSE_AFTER_WRITE)
      Mirrors bin/restore-rehearse.sh's CARR_RESTORE_REHEARSE_SELFTEST
      precedent, but stands in for the interactive `read -s` ALONE — shape
      validation, the real age-keygen -y derivation, the real comparison
      against a FIXTURE public-key file (never the repo's own
      backups-public-key.txt), and — on a match — the real call into
      bin/restore-rehearse.sh, all still execute for real.

  CARR_RESTORE_REHEARSE_SELFTEST(_*)
      bin/restore-rehearse.sh's OWN existing selftest hook (proven by
      ops/restore-rehearse-record-selftest.py already). Environment variables
      are inherited by a child process automatically, so setting BOTH hooks on
      this suite's subprocess env means the match-path scenario genuinely
      exercises "key-recovery-test.sh really shells out to
      ./run.sh restore-rehearse --identity <path>", while the expensive,
      network/Neon-touching middle of THAT script is the one already-tested
      substitution — never a second, parallel stub written for this suite.

NEVER THE REAL KEY, NEVER THE REAL BACKUPS. Every identity this suite ever
types in is a throwaway keypair generated fresh, in a temp dir, by the real
age-keygen, for this run only. The fixture public-key files it compares
against are written to a temp dir too — backups-public-key.txt in the repo is
never read and never touched.

WHAT record_run() DOES, restated here because this suite exists to prove it:
called from bin/key-recovery-test.sh's own EXIT trap (cleanup(), which fires on
every exit path — a shape-invalid input, a pubkey mismatch, a failed real
restore, an interrupt, or the ordinary PASS at the bottom), it writes ONE
ops.run row through tools/ops-record.py — service restore-rehearse-weekly, key
restore.key-recovery (deliberately distinct from restore-rehearse.sh's own
restore.rehearsal, so the weekly drill and this paper-copy drill are never
confused in the ledger) — state succeeded/failed, a failure_class chosen from
three buckets (pubkey_mismatch, restore_failed, aborted), and a --detail line
naming which dump was used and that the identity came from the OFFLINE PAPER
COPY. --detail NEVER carries key material, by construction: it is built from
state flags and a dump filename, never from the typed value.

THE PROVENANCE LINE IS THE TESTED SURFACE, same discipline as
ops/restore-rehearse-record-selftest.py: record_run() prints its
`evidence: ... / detail: ...` block on stdout BEFORE it ever attempts the
database write, so this suite (DATABASE_URL deliberately unreachable, same
unreachable_env() helper) can assert against that line without a live
database, and a human reading a real transcript sees the same thing.

TIER 1 (always runs; no DB, no network beyond loopback-refused, no terminal).
Requires the real `age-keygen` binary on PATH — checked explicitly and skipped
with a clear NOT RUN note (never a silent pass) if it is absent, per rule
88e9b5eb: "not authorized" and "not possible" must never be reported as the
same finding. Present on Joe's Mac (verified while building this); not
installed by default on the CI runner as of this writing.

Covers: shape validation rejects a malformed typed value (failure_class
pubkey_mismatch, no restore attempted); a real mismatch between the typed
key's derived public key and a fixture public-key file (failure_class
pubkey_mismatch, no restore attempted, neither key ever printed); a real match
that proceeds into a REAL call to bin/restore-rehearse.sh, chained through
THAT script's own selftest hook to a synthetic PASS (exit 0, detail names the
dump); a real match whose restore then fails (failure_class restore_failed);
an interrupt (SIGINT to the whole process group, matching what a terminal's
Ctrl-C actually delivers) sent while the script is deliberately paused right
after writing the identity file, proving the temp file and its containing
directory are BOTH gone afterward and the run is recorded aborted; and, across
every scenario, that the throwaway secret key value never appears verbatim in
the script's stdout or stderr.

TIER 2 (a genuine key-recovery drill, run only by Joe, only with the real
paper copy) is deliberately NOT part of this file — it needs a human typing
from paper and touches production's real ops.run row. That live proof is
`./run.sh key-recovery-test` itself.

    DELETING WAS THE BUG, and this is the suite where it cost the most. The
    helper used to point DATABASE_URL at a dead port and unset
    CARR_DB_JOBS_URL — airtight while `run` was connect("write"), because
