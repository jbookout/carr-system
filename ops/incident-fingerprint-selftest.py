"""Selftest for the incident fingerprint and the success-clears decision.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Process-audit council, 2026-08-23, recommendation 3. Two
things were measured wrong with the incident ledger and this file holds the
guard on both fixes.

THE FIRST IS THE FINGERPRINT'S FOURTH FIELD. 0116 made the signature
service|environment|run_key|failure_class and made two open incidents with one
signature impossible — that part works, and partner-ping's 89 failed runs on
2026-08-23 really were one incident. But the fourth field arrives in two
registers. Some callers name a diagnosis (pubkey_mismatch, restore_failed);
bin/nightly.sh passes the wrapper's exit code through as exit_<n>. So
nightly.vault-drift-watch was open TWICE at once — as exit_2 and as exit_69 —
and nightly.portability-mirror had failed as exit_1, exit_2 and exit_69 across
four days. One job, one remedy, three fingerprints.

THE COUNCIL'S KILL CONDITION IS THE HARD PART, and most of the cases below are
it: "distinct failure classes on the same job must NOT collapse into one row."
It is easy to make the churn go away by making the fingerprint broad, and that
trade is strictly worse than the churn — restore-rehearse-weekly's
pubkey_mismatch, restore_failed and aborted are three different pieces of work
on one job, and a fingerprint that merged them would hide two of them behind a
row somebody already looked at. So the normalization is narrow by construction:
it rewrites ONLY the exit_<n> shape, and even there it keeps every code this
codebase has given a meaning of its own.

THE SECOND IS THAT NOTHING EVER CLEARED. On 2026-08-23 five incidents were open
with twelve consecutive green runs behind them, because the repo's only close
path needs the owner credential 0117 withholds from carr_jobs, so bin/nightly.sh
prints `incident sweep (admin capability unavailable)` every night and sweeps
nothing. recovery_decision is the replacement rule, and a rule that will
rubber-stamp anything is worse than none, because then the pile only LOOKS
handled. Every refusal below is a reason the job role may be trusted with the
close at all.

WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT SEE, said out loud: the database half. The refusals are
enforced a second time inside ops.clear_recovered_incident (migration 0293),
whose own proof block runs at apply time — SEV-1, hand-opened incidents, a
short sequence, and a failure inside the sequence are each refused there too,
so a wrong answer in this Python still cannot close anything. This file is the
cheap guard that runs on every push; that one is the guarantee.
