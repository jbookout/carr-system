"""ops/outage-drill-selftest.py — the acceptance test for bin/outage-drill.py,
Program 4's synthetic degraded-mode harness.

TWO TIERS, matching the house pattern in ops/run-scheduled-selftest.py and
ops/restore-rehearse-record-selftest.py.

TIER 1 (always runs; no staging credential, no network). Drives the REAL
harness as a subprocess for everything that does not need a live database or
a live Worker: --list, --dry-run, unknown-drill handling, and the two drills
that are fully local — model-provider-unavailable (a fixture `claude` binary,
no network) and settings-change-db-outage (a genuinely unreachable DSN, no
staging credential needed for the MECHANICS, only for the evidence write at
the end — see the note on that below).

TIER 1 ALSO PROVES THE SPOOL-ERA RECORDER CONTRACT (added 2026-08-18), with no
credential and no network, by driving the REAL bin/run-scheduled.sh through the
drill's OWN env helpers. This is the half of drill 1 that went wrong when
tools/ops-spool.py landed: an unreachable ledger stopped being a recording
failure, so the drill's "recorder_exit is non-zero" assertion inverted and would
have reported a lie where the system was in fact deferring durably. The two
states are checked here directly, where a regression shows up on every push
rather than only on a machine with a staging credential.

TIER 2 (only when a staging credential is actually available — gated behind
CARR_OUTAGE_DRILL_SELFTEST_LIVE=1, never on by default, because it spends a
Neon staging round trip and a real HTTP call to the staging Worker on every
invocation otherwise). Runs record-layer-unreachable, stale-observation and
worker-unreachable for real and checks their verdicts. Both database drills
additionally mint an ephemeral isolated-staging carr_jobs credential through
tools/staging_jobs_dsn.py; on a machine that cannot resolve staging at all they
skip, and this suite says so rather than reporting a bare failure.

WHY TIER 1's LOCAL DRILLS STILL NEED "LIVE" LOOSELY DEFINED: both
model-provider-unavailable and settings-change-db-outage end by calling
record_evidence(), which needs a staging DSN to write the evidence row. This
suite does not stub that: it lets the evidence write attempt for real and
tolerates either outcome (recorded, or a loud EVIDENCE WARNING on stderr) —
same no-mock discipline as the rest of this repo's selftests, and consistent
with bin/outage-drill.py's own DrillResult/record_evidence separation: the
DRILL's verdict (checked here) and whether the evidence WRITE itself landed
are two different facts.
