p1-environment-gate.py — THE ACCEPTANCE TEST FOR PROGRAM 1, SAFE ENVIRONMENTS,
written before the thing it tests (rule e65efc68).

THE GATE, verbatim from the ordered implementation program: "staging cannot
access Production data or credentials."

That sentence has never been executable. The isolation itself was built on
2026-08-13 — a separate Neon project for the database half, a separate Worker
with its own bindings for the compute half — and wrangler.toml argues the case
at length in prose. Prose is not proof. Nothing has ever ASKED the two
environments whether they are still separate, and nothing would notice the day
they stopped being.

WHY THIS IS NOT A CI GATE. ops/ci.sh's migration class runs against a throwaway
Postgres, which is neither of the two environments this asks about. The
question here is about the REAL projects, so it runs where their credentials
live: this machine, from the nightly chain. A gate pointed at a stand-in would
answer about the stand-in.

WHAT PROVOKED IT. On 2026-08-15 the staging database was found FOUR migrations
behind production, including the one carrying P0-1's release object. Nothing
detected that. It surfaced only because a person went to run an acceptance test
there and got "relation ops.release does not exist". An environment nobody
checks is an environment nobody can trust, and G1 rests on trusting this one.

THE SIX ASSERTIONS.

  1. TWO PROJECTS, NOT TWO BRANCHES. Staging resolves to a different Neon
     project than production, on a different host. A Neon BRANCH lives inside
     its parent project and starts as a copy of its data, so a branch would
     hand staging exactly the production rows this gate exists to keep away
     from it. Only a separate project delivers the isolation.

  2. THE CREDENTIALS ARE NOT THE SAME CREDENTIAL. The two connection strings
     differ. Neither is ever printed, compared only by digest, because a live
     credential reached a session transcript on 2026-08-13 and the project had
     to be destroyed and rebuilt over it.

  3. NO ROW IN STAGING SHARES AN ID WITH A ROW IN PRODUCTION. Identity is the
     test, because identity is what "production data" means. Ids are compared,
     never names, emails or phones, and an overlap is reported as a COUNT — so
     a leak is detectable without this gate reading or printing one field of
     client data. The first version demanded ZERO rows in staging and failed on
     its first run against a synthetic fixture; the environment contract
     defines staging's data as "sanitized representative fixtures or dedicated
     test data", so an empty-table test asks for something never required and
     would fail every time anyone rehearsed anything.

  4. THE STAGING WORKER SHARES NO BINDING. Parsed from wrangler.toml: its own
     Worker name, its own KV namespace, and no routes or custom domains at all.
     A staging environment that shares any one of those is production wearing a
     different label.

  5. STAGING IS CURRENT WITH THE REPOSITORY. Its applied migration set equals
     the committed set. This is the assertion that would have caught the
     2026-08-15 drift on the day it appeared instead of six days later.

  6. PRODUCTION IS CURRENT WITH THE REPOSITORY. The same question pointed the
     other way, so a migration sitting unapplied in production is visible daily
     rather than at the moment somebody needs it.

WHERE IT RUNS. Locally, from bin/nightly.sh, and by hand:

    .venv/bin/python ops/p1-environment-gate.py

IT WRITES NOTHING TO EITHER DATABASE. Production is opened read-only at the
session level, and staging is only counted and queried. The nightly wrapper
records the OUTCOME to the operational ledger; this file reports.
