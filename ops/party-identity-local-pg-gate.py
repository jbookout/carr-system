"""Rollback-only proof for migration 0851 (correct-party-identity, rule 8cddc6ad).

party_reference_counts decides whether an org row is shared before the verb
renames it, so a wrong count renames a row other records ride. This proves, as
the role the verb runs under (carr_writer), that the count:

1. sees other people on the org (party.org_id) and skips the corrected party;
2. ignores merged tombstones and soft-deleted people;
3. counts a non-person reference (a client row on the org) as sharing;
4. is not executable by carr_reader.

It also proves carr_writer can call the shared org helpers the verb uses
(org_identity_key, org_party_id) and carr_reader can read the undo view.
