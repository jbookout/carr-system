"""ops/pr-actor-selftest.py — the acceptance test for ops/pr_actor.py.

WHAT THE ACTOR IS FOR. ops/pr-hygiene-check.py notices a stranded pull request;
this clears it. Joe's direction on 2026-08-15: "we are actively moving away from
AI running the system and more into code running the system", which is his own
2026-08-13 rule (never spend a model on anything already expressible as a tested
predicate) restated because a session proposed a model-driven scheduled routine
for work that is finitely specifiable.

TWO TIERS, the house pattern.

TIER 1 (always runs, no network, no credential): the DECISION function. Given a
pull request's shape it returns one of close-superseded / rebase / resolve-
generated / report-only, and nothing else. Pure, so this is where the real
coverage lives.

TIER 2 (always runs, but builds throwaway git repositories in a temp dir): the
git MECHANICS, exercised against real repositories rather than mocks — a branch
merely behind main, a branch whose only conflict is a declared generated file,
and a branch with a genuine source conflict that must be refused. No network:
these are local clones, so `push` is a push to a local bare remote.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TESTED HERE: the GitHub API calls. They are a thin
shell over `gh`, and asserting on a mocked `gh` would prove only that the mock
was written to match the caller. The actor never closes or pushes without
--execute, and the plan it prints under --dry-run is the reviewable artifact.
