unlinked-file-ask-selftest.py — fixtures for the unlinked-file-ask half of
hooks/chat-lint-gate.py, written before it (rule e65efc68).

THE RULE, 8c1e6057, in Joe's own words: "in the future if you need me to edit a
file - always include the link to the file like you have above. that was way
easier". Its statement: whenever a partner is asked to edit, open, or review a
file, the message must carry a clickable markdown link to that file, never just
the path in prose.

THE HOLE, bucket U in the 2026-08-14 enforceability audit and probed still open
the hour this was written. Four shapes were fed to chat-lint-gate's own scan()
and every one passed, including "Take a look at deliverables/loi.docx and tell
me if the term is right." The harness prompt asks for markdown links in prose;
prose does not bind, which is the standing reason gates exist here.

WHY THIS IS A PREDICATE AND NOT A JUDGMENT. The binding condition has two
halves and both are mechanical: an ASK VERB aimed at the reader (open, edit,
review, look at, check, sign, approve) and a FILE PATH that is not already
wrapped as a markdown link. Neither needs the meaning of the sentence.

THE FALSE POSITIVE THAT WOULD KILL IT is the ordinary report. Session messages
name paths constantly — this very suite's own commit message names six — and a
check that fired on every mention would be muted within a day. A MENTION IS NOT
AN ASK: the ask verb must be present, and it must be pointed at the reader
rather than describing what the session itself did.

WHAT MUST STAY TRUE:
  1. An ask carrying a bare path is flagged.
  2. The same ask carrying a proper markdown link is NOT. This is the direction
     a carve-out tested only on the refusing side loses first.
  3. A path merely MENTIONED, with no ask, is never flagged.
  4. A session narrating its OWN reads and writes is never flagged — "I opened
     x.py" is not asking anyone to do anything.
  5. Code fences are exempt, exactly as the rest of this gate treats them.
  6. It never fires on prose that has no path in it at all.

RUNNING IT. No database, no network, no vault:
