# last raw disk read was sourced from the records instead. Only
# upstream corroborate is left, and it waits on an external intake.
# Two as of 2026-08-23, down from thirteen. The corpus push left once the
# tool learned to hold its vault rows itself, so its twelve live
# home-rooted rows stopped being switched off by a retired root.
# Before that, three. The consumer boards and
# lead promote left last: neither was ever blocked on a destination,
# only on a pool read that gave up before trying the path that worked.
# Before that, five as of 2026-08-22. The portability mirror
# left last, repointed to the same OneDrive root as the exports.
# Before that, six: the exports gained a
        # canonical destination (CARR OneDrive, decision bdbb7441), the section
        # index and system graph were found already writing inside the repo and
        # only unmarked, and four retired outright — cutover readiness, the
