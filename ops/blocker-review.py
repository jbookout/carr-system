"""blocker-review.py — test every open loop's stated blocker against reality, and
report only the ones that have DEMONSTRABLY CLEARED.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Joe, 2026-08-10: "You spam loops all day and never built
anything towards actually working through the loops." He is right, and the
numbers say how right: 404 loops created, 161 ever closed, 243 open. Loops are
cheap to create and expensive to close, so the pile only grows.

`add-loop` already refuses an open loop that does not name a blocker from a
closed list — a genuinely good control, added because "later" is not a reason.
But the blocker is captured at creation and NEVER RE-READ. A grep across
pipelines/, exporters/ and tools/health-check.py for `blocker` returns nothing.
So a loop whose counterparty replied three weeks ago is indistinguishable from
one blocked this morning, and both sit in the same undifferentiated 243.

THE POINT OF THIS SCRIPT, stated as the thing it must never become: it is NOT
another report. It answers one question — WHICH OF THESE CAN BE WORKED RIGHT NOW
— and its output is a short list, or nothing. A list of 243 is what we already
have.

WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DECIDE. Each blocker class gets a test only where the
record can actually answer it. Where it cannot, the row is left alone and said so
out loud rather than guessed at, because a false "unblocked" costs more than a
missed one: it puts work in front of a partner that is still blocked, and two of
those teach him to stop reading the list.

  counterparty    CLEARABLE IN PRINCIPLE, AND NOT UNDER THIS CREDENTIAL. The test
                  wants any contact-kind activity logged against the party the
                  detail names, since the loop was raised. That reads activity,
                  activity_kind, party and the client/lead/vendor union — four
                  base tables. app_exporter_local, the credential this script
                  runs under, can read NONE of them: measured 2026-08-21,
                  has_table_privilege returns loop_item=True and activity,
                  activity_kind, party, client, lead, vendor all False. The
                  exporter is view-scoped on purpose (79 of 79 views readable,
                  zero base tables), so this is a deliberate boundary and not a
                  missing grant to go and add. Until a view exposes party name
                  beside last contact date, the branch reports itself untestable
                  IN THE OUTPUT rather than crashing or, worse, quietly
                  answering "nothing cleared".
  external_event  CLEARABLE. A dated wait whose date has passed is no longer a
                  wait. due_on is the date; loops carrying none are skipped.
  capability      PARTLY CLEARABLE, and the docstring used to overstate it. It
                  claimed a verb, a view and a credential were all checkable;
                  the code under it did nothing but `unknown += 1`. Two of the
                  three are real and are implemented here: a named RELATION is
                  tested against the catalog, and a named CREDENTIAL against the
                  environment and ~/.config/carr/*.env. A named VERB is NOT
                  tested and must never clear on one — the checkout's tools.js
                  is not proof of what production runs. On 2026-08-21 production
                  sat 12 commits behind main, so a verb sitting in the source
                  tree was genuinely absent from the live Worker. Read the verb
                  count off /release if that test is ever wanted.
  other_lane      CLEARABLE where the row names a loop number. If that loop is
                  closed, this one is no longer waiting on it.
  ruling          NOT CLEARABLE. A ruling is a human's to make and nothing in the
                  record says he has made it.
  human_only      NOT CLEARABLE, by definition. Counted and reported so the size
                  of the genuinely-human pile is visible, which is itself a
                  number worth seeing.

CLOSES NOTHING. Deliberately. This surfaces; a session or a partner decides. An
auto-closer would be the same defect in the other direction — the system deciding
work is done because a proxy went green, which is exactly the "success signal not
derived from the artifact" failure the health check already carries scars from.
