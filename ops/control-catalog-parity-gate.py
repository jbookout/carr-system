"""Rollback-only acceptance gate: the control catalog matches the repository.

WHAT THIS DEFENDS. ops.enforcement_control_catalog decides which controls
approve-rule will accept as real enforcement. Until 2026-08-22 it was populated
by a hand-written migration per control, and the two copies drifted exactly as
two copies do: the repository's enforcement map declared 59 controls and the
table held 3, so approving a rule enforced by any of the other 56 required
shipping SQL first. That is the red tape the map-as-source change removes.

Removing the second transcription only helps if the projection cannot silently
fall behind again, which is what this gate is for. It compiles the catalog from
ops/config/rule-enforcement-map.json exactly as ops/sync_control_catalog.py
does — same module, so the gate cannot check a different rule than the sync
applies — and compares it against the database the migration set built.

WHAT IT REFUSES, and why each half matters:

  MISSING       a control the map declares that the table does not carry.
                approve-rule would refuse a rule the repository believes is
                enforced, and the refusal would name nothing useful.

  UNDECLARED    a control in the table that the map does not declare. This is
                reported, never auto-deleted: an orphan row may still be
                enforcing an active rule, and removing it is a decision. But it
                must not pass silently, because an unreviewed row in this table
                is an unreviewed claim about what counts as enforcement.

  DISAGREEMENT  a control whose class, implementation, test or installed flag
                differs between the two. Installed drift is the dangerous one:
                a control marked installed whose test nothing runs is precisely
                the "recitation is not enforcement" failure (rule ab814a26).

Writes nothing: every statement runs inside a transaction that is rolled back.
