"""ops/trigger-grant-check.py — an invoker-rights trigger's reads must be
granted to the role that fires it (rule 5409731b).

THE RULE: a new trigger changes the permission surface of every verb that
writes its table. Before that migration ships, list every table the trigger
body reads and confirm the WRITING role holds SELECT on each. A plain
foreign-key check runs as the referenced table's owner and needs no grant; an
invoker-rights plpgsql trigger runs AS THE CALLER and dies on any ungranted
read.

WHAT IT COST WHEN SKIPPED, from the rule's own text. 0060's side-validation
trigger read participant_role, which 0017 had left ungranted on the reasoning
that foreign-key checks run as owner — true, and irrelevant to a trigger read.
set-lead broke silently in production for FIVE DAYS (2026-08-03 to 2026-08-08).
It was invisible because the existing lead rows were import-written and every
rehearsal ran as owner, and grants never fire for the owner. That is the 0076
blind spot the rule names, and it is why this check must run AS A ROLE QUESTION
against a real database rather than as a read-through of the SQL.

WHY THIS ASKS POSTGRES INSTEAD OF READING THE MIGRATIONS. A static version was
prototyped first, and it reported ZERO gaps — not because there were none, but
because its grant parsing found no writers at all, so the comparison loop never
ran once. Green meant "parsed nothing". The permission model here is genuinely
subtle: 0004's `grant ... on all tables in schema public` is a ONE-TIME grant
that does not reach any table created afterwards, which is exactly why
participant_role, created in 0060, was ungranted while dozens of older tables
were fine. Reimplementing that in a regex is where false confidence lives.

So the database answers both halves it can answer. pg_trigger and pg_proc
enumerate the triggers, their functions, and whether each is SECURITY DEFINER.
has_table_privilege() and has_column_privilege() answer every permission
question. The only textual step left is pulling table names out of prosrc, and
even those are intersected with pg_class, so a CTE name, an alias or a plpgsql
keyword cannot become a phantom table.

THE COLUMN-GRANT TRAP, which cost two wrong designs before this one. 0078 fixed
the incident with a COLUMN-scoped grant: `grant select (side) on
participant_role to carr_writer`. has_table_privilege() returns FALSE for that,
so a TABLE-ONLY test reports today's healthy schema as broken — a false refusal
aimed at a fix already in place.

The obvious repair, "table-level OR any column-level", was written next and the
fixture killed it. Revoking exactly the grant 0078 added left an unrelated
`select (slug)` in place, so "any column" stayed true and the check passed while
the trigger would still have died in production. It under-detected the one
incident it exists to catch.

So the question is asked per COLUMN: the identifiers in the function body,
intersected with the read table's real column list, must each be SELECT-able by
the writing role. Intersecting with pg_attribute is what keeps a phantom name
from being required, and NEW.x / OLD.x are stripped first because those are the
TRIGGERING table's columns rather than the read table's. Where a body names the
table but none of its columns (`select 1 from t`, `count(*)`), any read access
is enough — there is no column to be precise about.

SKIPS WITHOUT A DATABASE rather than passing. A check that cannot look and
reports OK is worse than one that says it did not run.
