unread-artifact-gate-selftest.py — acceptance test for hooks/unread-artifact-gate.py,
written before the gate (rule e65efc68).

WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-08-14 one session filed four defects against itself, and
every one had the same shape underneath: a confident, well-formed claim about an
artifact the session had never opened. The evidence was always a PROXY —

  · a grep hit. "tools/health-check.py writes the radar digest" came from a
    filename match. The file only WATCHES it, and the ten lines around the hit
    said so. That wrong name shipped into the one message whose entire job is
    telling a job's author which job to fix.
  · a rendering. "the write landed on a tombstone" cited three read surfaces as
    three confirmations. They are one collection, and the thing under suspicion
    was how records render. One SQL read settled it the other way.
  · a header, unread. Five files were described as holding content that needed
    routing through verbs. Each says "GENERATED" in its own first line.
  · an imported function. A ruling was called drift while the twenty lines above
    the function that produced the verdict explained why the verdict had changed.

EVERY EXISTING GATE MISSED ALL FOUR, and not by accident. They check claims
against RULES and DECISIONS. These statements broke no rule and contradicted no
ruling. They were simply false, and false in a way that reads as authoritative.

THE ONE MECHANICAL SIGNAL THEY SHARE: the reply asserts what a file DOES, and
this session never read that file. The transcript records every tool call, so
that is a checkable question rather than a judgement.

GREP IS NOT A READ, and that is the sharp edge of this gate. A grep hit proves a
string occurs; it says nothing about whether the line is a write, a watch, a
comment, or a test fixture. Treating it as knowledge is precisely the failure
above, so a path known only through grep counts as UNREAD here.

WHAT IT MUST GET RIGHT:

  1. A BEHAVIOURAL CLAIM, not a mention. "Committed hooks/foo.py" asserts
     nothing about foo.py. "hooks/foo.py writes the digest" does. Only the
     second is this gate's business, or it fires on every status report and gets
     muted.
  2. AUTHORSHIP COUNTS AS KNOWLEDGE. A file this session Wrote or Edited is one
     it knows. Flagging those would make every build turn noisy.
  3. FIRE ONCE. A Stop hook that blocks the same reply forever is a session that
     cannot end.
  4. FAIL OPEN. No transcript, an unreadable line, a parse error: none may
     strand a turn.

Hermetic: throwaway transcripts, no repo state.
