"""Behavioral contract for ops/rule-jit-compile.py (WR-000019 slice S9).

PINS:
  1. The committed ops/config/rule-jit-triggers.v1.json is exactly what the
     current inputs compile to (--check passes on the real repo state).
  2. Determinism: compiling the same inputs twice yields byte-identical output.
  3. Every trigger's rule_ids is non-empty, sorted, unique, and at most
     max_rules_per_trigger long (the over-delivery cap).
  4. Every rule_id referenced by a seeded_detector or pack_fallback trigger is
     a real JIT-home id in rule-triage.v1.json.
  5. A rule carrying a `detector` field is covered by exactly one
     seeded_detector trigger group (never split across two).
  6. A synthetic 6th rule sharing one (kind, pattern) with 5 already-seeded
     rules is truncated to 5 by the cap, deterministically (lowest ids kept).
  7. fallback_narrowing removes its excluded term from the compiled pack
     fallback pattern, and a pack with every trigger word excluded contributes
     no fallback trigger for that pack at all.
  8. structural_extra rows are stable and independent of rule-triage content
     (present even if no rule anywhere carries a detector).
