"""ops/onedrive-prepublish-wake.py — a single-shot nudge to the OneDrive File
Provider, run as its own nightly.sh step immediately BEFORE "exports (6
targets -> OneDrive)".

WHY THIS EXISTS (defect: nightly.exports failed 9/22, 9/23, 9/24; on 9/24 it
consumed the entire 1800s step wall-clock with no partial output at all — see
out/nightly-runs/nightly-20260924T080221Z.log). Jev put the OneDrive File
Provider idling overnight at 0.71.

exporters.common.wait_for_provider() already waits up to
PROVIDER_WAIT_BUDGET_SECONDS (1200s) for the provider before the exports
begin, and bin/nightly.sh's "exports" step already runs under an 1800s
EXTERNAL wall-clock (bin/with-timeout.py, which kills the whole process
group). That external wrapper is what actually bounds a genuinely wedged
read — a Python-level deadline check inside wait_for_provider's loop can
only run BETWEEN probes, and a single probe against a File Provider that has
gone fully dark can block past any internal budget with no error at all,
which is consistent with the 9/24 run producing zero "[provider] ... cold"
lines before it was killed at exactly 1800s.

THIS STEP DOES NOT REPLACE wait_for_provider(). It buys it a head start: one
plain stat + small read per live export path, single attempt, no internal
retry loop and no internal budget of its own — the boundedness comes entirely
from the SAME external per-step wall-clock every other nightly.sh step
already uses (bin/step-timeout.zsh / bin/with-timeout.py), configured short
(see STEP_TIMEOUT_OVERRIDE["onedrive pre-publish wake"] in
bin/step-timeout.zsh) so that even a fully wedged probe costs the chain only
that step's own small budget, never the exports step's larger one.

A cold or unreadable file here is NOT a failure: this step's only job is to
ask the File Provider to start hydrating before the real writes need it to
have already done so. Every outcome is reported and the step exits 0
regardless, matching step()'s existing "the chain survives a step that
fails, never survives one that hangs" contract — this step cannot itself
make the chain hang any longer than its own short external timeout allows.
