"""ops/stale-count-selftest.py — acceptance test for ops/stale-count-check.py.

WHAT THE CHECK IS FOR. Rule b01edd26 bans a hardcoded count a later edit can
falsify. On 2026-08-14/15 that rule was violated four separate times inside the
enforcement layer itself, and each one needed its own pull request to fix: the
Stop door said "NINE times", the write door said "8 times", the audit-queue
check said "11 occurrences", and the drift selftest said "NINE times" — while
the ledger climbed to twelve. A gate whose whole job is catching a stale figure
quoted as present state was quoting one, in the sentence meant to persuade.

Three passes by hand still missed a fifth site, which is why this is code.

THE PREDICATE, and getting it narrow is the entire design. A first attempt
flagged any quantity next to a countable noun and produced 173 hits across the
repo, nearly all of them ordinary prose ("it reads two version strings", "fired
five times a week"). A baseline that size gets muted, and a muted check is worse
than none.

What actually goes stale is a count over an OPEN-ENDED window — one still
accumulating as the system runs. "has failed nine times", "11 occurrences",
"eight times since 2026-08-04". What does NOT go stale is a count over a CLOSED
window: "on the night this was written he was right five times out of five" is
true forever. The date is not the discriminator — the damaging lines carried
dates too, because `since <date>` opens a window rather than closing one.

Narrowed that way the same scan returns two hits across 382 files.

QUOTED HISTORY IS EXEMPT. A line that quotes a prior value while documenting its
correction — `carried "11 occurrences" and the ledger moved to twelve` — is a
record of the fix, not a live claim. The number sits inside quotes; a live claim
never does.
