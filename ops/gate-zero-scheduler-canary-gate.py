"""The Gate Zero scheduler canary, end to end, against a disposable ledger.

WHAT THIS PROVES, and why a text assertion could not. Gate Zero's fourth
predecessor step, `step:scheduler-active-receipt`, is answered by card 12 of
mcp-server/src/gate-zero-seam-readers.v5.js, which wants an ops.run row that is
bound to a receipt the scheduler wrapper minted, plus an observation strictly
after that dispatch. Three separate programs have to agree for that row to
exist: the LaunchAgent definition (ops/launchd/com.carr.gate-zero-canary.plist),
the wrapper (bin/run-scheduled.sh), and the recorder behind it
(tools/ops-spool.py -> tools/ops-record.py). This gate runs all three for real
and then reads the result back through the real reader.

THE DEFECT THAT MADE IT NECESSARY, found in review of PR #1006. The canary's
first revision passed a retired `evidence ref file` option and a path. The
wrapper's option loop recognises only the two heartbeat options and treats
anything else as the first POSITIONAL argument, so the flag became the service
key, the path became the run key, and the scheduler tried to execute the word
`gate-zero-canary` as a program. Nothing in the repository would have noticed:
every assertion about the canary was a text assertion about files that were
never run together. So this gate takes the plist's OWN ProgramArguments, with
nothing retyped, and runs them.

WHAT IT WRITES AND WHERE. One ops.run row, through the real spool and the real
recorder, on a disposable local carr_ci database it refuses to run without. The
row is deleted again at the end. The wrapper is exercised from a private
INSTALL ROOT rather than from this checkout: the receipt path bin/run-scheduled.sh
derives is fixed by the script's own location ($REPO/out/run-scheduled-receipts),
out/ is shared by every worktree on this Mac, and two concurrent runs of this
gate would otherwise race for one leaf and record a row with no receipt. That
is the same reason ops/run-scheduled-selftest.py owns an install rather than
passing a path.

RUN IT BY HAND:
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://carr_ci@127.0.0.1:55432/carr_ci \
      .venv/bin/python ops/gate-zero-scheduler-canary-gate.py
