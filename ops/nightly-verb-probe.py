"""nightly-verb-probe.py — what the nightly chain CAN verify unattended.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-04, loop #178, Joe's go). `mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh`
exercised every read verb end-to-end through the Worker, and it was the only
thing proving the verbs actually worked. It authenticated with a static bearer
from ~/.config/carr/mcp-tokens.env — the legacy PARTNER_TOKENS path — which was
deliberately retired on 2026-08-03 (commit 5b13ed7). The Worker no longer has
code that validates it, so `invalid_token` is now correct and permanent, and the
suite has been dead in the chain ever since: 23 probes, 0 passed, every night.

THE FORK JOE RULED. Three options were on the table: mint a machine credential
for /mcp, point the probes at the database, or accept the suite as
interactive-only. Reintroducing a machine bearer would partly undo a retirement
made on purpose. So the chain gets what it CAN check without a partner identity,
and the full Worker suite stays a post-deploy, human-present run.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, and the reasoning for each half.

(1) THE WORKER IS DEPLOYED AND ITS AUTH GATE IS LIVE. /health must answer 200
and /mcp must REFUSE an unauthenticated call with 401. The second is the load-
bearing one: a Worker that stops rejecting anonymous callers is a security
failure that a reachability check alone would score green. Both hosts are
probed, because api.doctorcre.com became primary on 2026-08-01 and the alias
api.practicecre.com is what several scripts still name.

(2) EVERY VIEW THE VERBS READ IS STILL QUERYABLE. This is the half that replaces
real coverage rather than gesturing at it. The read verbs are thin wrappers over
v_* views, so the failure that actually bites is a migration changing or breaking
one — sixteen migrations landed in a single day on 2026-08-02. A view that has
been dropped, renamed, or left referencing a removed column fails here on the
night it breaks instead of the next time a human happens to call the verb.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK, stated so nobody reads a green row as more
than it is: transport, MCP tool dispatch, argument validation, and verb-level
answer correctness. Those need the Worker path and a real grant. Run
`./mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh` after every deploy, from an interactive session
that holds a token. This probe is not a replacement for it and does not claim to
be.

ZERO ROWS IS NOT A FAILURE. A view returning nothing is a valid answer — most of
them legitimately empty out. Asserting row counts here would manufacture exactly
the false-alarm noise that trains people to ignore a check.

PERMISSION DENIED IS REPORTED, NOT FAILED. The exporter role genuinely lacks
SELECT on some objects by design. That is a config fact, not schema drift, so it
is listed and does not set the exit code. A view that has VANISHED is drift and
does fail.

Exit 0 = Worker gate healthy and every view queryable.
Exit 1 = at least one hard failure; the message carries the real error text.
Exit 0 with SKIP = no credential on this machine (house convention).
