"""ops/vendor-level-drift-selftest.py — acceptance test for the vendor-level check.

WHAT IT PROTECTS. Joe defined the relationship levels by countable events
(rule faf1b643) precisely so they stop being impressions: "you can email fifty
people and have fifty relationships that do not exist." The check exists to show
where the recorded level and the counted evidence disagree. The way that check
fails is not by crashing — it is by reporting so much that nobody reads it.

THE NOISE PROBLEM, measured on real data 2026-08-15: the crude comparison
`recorded is distinct from suggested` returns 239 of 301 active vendors. The
view's own `disagrees` column returns 16. The difference is 243 vendors with no
countable events at all, most of them Prospective vendors correctly recorded as
Prospective. A check that reports 239 findings on its first run is a check
somebody mutes on its first run, so the separation is the thing under test here.

IT MUST ALSO NEVER CHANGE A LEVEL. The rule says the level stays a human
judgment and is stored, not computed — a relationship can matter for reasons no
event count can see. This suite pins that the check is read-only in shape: it
classifies and ranks, and the arithmetic that decides what the evidence supports
lives in the view, not re-derived here where the two could drift apart.
