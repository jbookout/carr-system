# model-routing rule, and auto-gold at p >= 0.75 that contradicted that rule's
# own adjudicated trigger). The gold now comes from a REVIEW SET, per rule:
#   * every pair with p > the rule's lower bound (REVIEW_LOW, or
#     REVIEW_LOW_EXTENDED for a rule whose in-band gold rate was high), with
#     NO auto-gold at the top: p >= 0.75 is reviewed like the rest;
#   * every case carrying the rule's exact ACTION SIGNAL, whatever its p;
#   * a rule in ACTION_POLICY (an `exact` entry: its trigger IS the action) is
#     settled by the signal alone, like UNIVERSAL_POLICY;
#   * a `signal_implies_gold` entry settles gold on every case carrying the
#     signal (e.g. every subagent spawn binds the model-routing rule), so the
#     same action never gets two labels; the rule's other cases are reviewed.
# The signals live in ops/fixtures/rule-delivery-eval/action-signals.v2.json,
# written from each rule's statement, not from the production trigger table.
#
# FLOORS (round 4). A third review found same-feature pairs on both sides of
# the lower bound for rules still dense at it. So: rules flagged that way get
# a floor below 0 (every case reviewed); for every other rule, the pairs just
# below its bound are sampled (sample_below_floor), adjudicated, and the gold
# rate published; a sample above 10% gold lowers the floor again. The floors
# and every sample's gold rate are committed in review-floors.v2.json.
# A pair in the review set is gold iff its written adjudication says so;
# outside it, not gold. Jev (strict second pass) is evidence only: it scored
# some clearly binding pairs at 0.12-0.18, so it never decides.
