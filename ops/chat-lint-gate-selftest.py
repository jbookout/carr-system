"""chat-lint-gate-selftest.py — fixtures for hooks/chat-lint-gate.py, written
before the hook (rule e65efc68, enforcing rules 5be2f462 and 3a9dbafd).

TWO RULES, ONE MOMENT. Both bind the assistant's own outgoing chat text, and
the only place that text exists before Joe reads it is the Stop hook:

  5be2f462  the contrast-reframe and banned-vocab HARD regexes that already
            guard every prospect-visible surface (tools/writing-lint.py,
            enforced by lint-gate.py on file writes) finally reach the surface
            they were actually taught about: internal dialogue to Joe.
  3a9dbafd  never make a partner decode an ID. A bare 8-hex rule id or a bare
            'loop #250' with no plain words around it forces Joe to go look up
            what the thing is; the id must ride WITH its gloss.

SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Only the HARD ids the audit row names (vocab,
contrast-reframe, contrast-reframe-split) point at chat. contrast-compressed
stays off this surface: 'X, not Y' is REVIEW severity precisely because a
genuine correction of fact takes that shape, and honest technical chat is
full of genuine corrections. The em-dash ban stays prospect-only — chat and
this repo's own house style use em dashes on purpose. A lint that flags
half of every honest report gets muted in a day, and then it catches nothing.

FALSE-POSITIVE GUARDS THE CASES BELOW PIN DOWN: fenced code is exempt (git
output is full of hex), all-digit tokens are exempt (20260814 is a date, not
an id), and an id WITH plain words in its sentence is a gloss, not a bare id.

Spawns the REAL hook with REAL Stop payloads + transcript fixtures.

THE CONTRACT CHANGED 2026-08-16 and these fixtures pin the new one: a wording
fault no longer BLOCKS the turn, because the offending text has already reached
Joe and a block only buys a restatement he pays for twice (rule 1d50a3bb). The
gate now parks a note that hooks/chat-lint-carryover.py injects before the next
reply. CAUGHT = a note was parked; exit 2 is now itself a regression.
