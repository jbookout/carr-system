gate-baseline-cochange-selftest.py — the acceptance test for the gate/baseline
co-change half of ops/githooks/pre-commit, written before the check itself
(rule e65efc68, enforcing rule c0b38d80).

WHAT THE CHECK IS FOR. The blessed baseline (ops/config/gate-baseline.json) is
the only thing that lets a session distinguish "a gate changed on purpose" from
"something disabled a gate". Rule c0b38d80 says the re-bless rides in the SAME
commit as the gate change, and it has been violated twice for real:

  2026-08-12  a gate change landed without its bless, and main's baseline was
              later overwritten by a PR cut before it (repaired in 6e2be66).
  2026-08-14  a live hotfix to hooks/settings-change-gate.py sat uncommitted
              and unblessed in the shared checkout; every session that morning
              started under a GATE INTEGRITY FAILURE banner it could do
              nothing about.

Both incidents are the same shape: the gate moved, the baseline did not, and
every later session had to treat the enforcement layer as untrusted. A commit
is the one moment where the two can be forced to move together.

WHAT THE CHECK MUST DO:

  1. REFUSE a staged change to any hooks/*.py gate file when
     ops/config/gate-baseline.json is not staged with it.
  2. REFUSE when the baseline IS staged but its recorded hash does not match
     the staged gate content — a bless of the wrong bytes is the 2026-08-13
     false re-bless, not a bless.
  3. ALLOW the same commit once the baseline is re-blessed and staged.
  3b. AUTO-APPLY that re-bless (2026-08-23 gates council): the baseline update
     is fully determined by the staged bytes, so the check computes it and
     stages it into the SAME commit rather than refusing and making the author
     retype it. The invariant is untouched — gate and bless still land together,
     and a wrong-bytes bless is still impossible, because the auto-applied
     result is re-verified by the same code that would have refused it. What the
     auto-apply must NOT do is bless a gate DELETION (that is a retirement, not
     a content update) or touch an entry for a gate this commit does not stage.
     CARR_NO_AUTO_BLESS=1 restores refuse-and-explain, and the refusal text is
     still asserted here so the manual path cannot rot.
  4. IGNORE commits that touch no gate file and no wiring contract; ignore
     hooks/*-selftest.py, which gate-integrity deliberately does not protect.
  5. COVER the wiring contracts (rule-enforcement-map.json and friends) the
     same way — a contract changes enforcement without touching a hook.
  6. HAVE A WORKING ESCAPE HATCH, same idiom as its neighbours:
     CARR_ALLOW_UNBLESSED_GATE=1 for one command.
  7. NOT TOUCH the repository that invoked it (the ops/git_env.py leak).

RUNNING IT. No database, no network, no production access:

    .venv/bin/python ops/gate-baseline-cochange-selftest.py

ops/ci.sh already globs ops/*-selftest.py, so this is enforced from the commit
that adds it, with no CI change.
