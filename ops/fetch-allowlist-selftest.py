"""fetch-allowlist-selftest.py — the allowlist's SOURCE path, proven offline.

WHY THIS EXISTS NOW (2026-08-19). ops/fetch-allowlist.py had no selftest at all,
and it had just grown a second way to read its data: the `export-email-domains`
verb first, the direct database connection only as a fallback. That change was
made so a SECOND machine needs no database credential — this one query was the
only thing on Dell's Mac that required one — and a change made for a security
reason has to be provable without the thing it removes.

It also cannot be proven the obvious way. The verb is not reachable from CI, and
the fallback needs a production credential CI must never hold, so both live
paths are unavailable exactly where the proof is wanted. Everything here stubs
the boundary instead: the verb path is a fake subprocess result, the database
path is a fake connection. What is being tested is the CHOOSING and the
PARSING, which is where the mistakes actually were — the first version of the
parser reported the failure reason as "}" because it read the last line of a
JSON error payload.

WHAT IS PINNED, and each is a real failure this file would have caught:
  1. The verb is preferred when it answers. If that inverts, a machine with a
     credential silently stops exercising the path the other machine depends on,
     and the verb rots unnoticed until it is the only option.
  2. A verb failure falls back and SAYS SO in the notes. A silent fallback would
     hide the verb being broken for as long as one machine still has a
     credential.
  3. A verb failure on a machine with NO credential raises rather than writing
     an empty list. An empty allowlist is not a smaller allowlist; it strips
     every client domain the guard trusts, and it looks identical to a book
     with no clients.
  4. The policy filter still runs on whichever path supplied the domains.
     Free-mail exclusion is by SUFFIX, so a subdomain of a free-mail host must
     not survive either route.
