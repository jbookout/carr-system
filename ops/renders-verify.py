"""renders-verify.py — the render-tamper detector (wave 1 C1, decision a317439f).

For every export target whose latest ok run stored a file_sha (0073), re-hash
the live vault file and compare. A mismatch means the render was modified by
something OTHER than the exporter after it was written — Drive web edit,
another device, partial sync, or a gate bypass — the exact class that silently
destroyed V-BNK-050.

Health-row contract per rule 590b11e1 (no metric without a bound action): the
output line names its response inline. On mismatch: re-export the named target
(CARR_EXPORT_LIVE=1 ./run.sh export --only <t> ) AND investigate what touched
the file, because a re-export alone erases the evidence of the edit.

Prints ONE line. Exit 0 OK / 1 mismatch / 2 SKIP.
