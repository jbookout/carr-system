"""ci-secret-scan.py — refuse a tree that carries a live credential.

WHY THIS IS HAND-WRITTEN RATHER THAN gitleaks/trufflehog. The scan has to run
identically in two places: a GitHub runner and Joe's Mac at push time. rule
a8c55a47 says a manual path and an automated path doing the same job must be the
same code, and the cheapest way to guarantee that is a scanner with no install
step, no network fetch and no version to drift. It is stdlib only, so it cannot
be the reason a check is skipped.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR. High-confidence, shaped credentials only — the ones whose
format is distinctive enough that a match is almost never a false positive. It
deliberately does NOT do generic entropy scoring. An entropy scanner in a repo
holding 947 markdown files, migration SQL and doctrine prose produces noise, and
a noisy gate is one people learn to bypass, which is worse than no gate.

THREE BIND-MOMENTS, ONE IMPLEMENTATION. Rule a8c55a47 again: the scan that runs
at commit, at push and in hosted CI must be the same code, so the scope is a
FLAG rather than a second scanner.

  * --staged      the blobs entering the index, INCLUDING newly added files.
                  This is the cheap moment, and it is the one that was missing.
                  The default scope reads files git already TRACKS, so a brand-new
                  file carrying a key passed every local check until `git add`
                  made it tracked -- and then failed at pre-push, the most
                  expensive boundary a session can hit. Sessions hit it often
                  enough to be written down as a standing gotcha. Reading the
                  INDEX rather than the working tree also means a partially
                  staged file is judged by the bytes actually being committed.
  * --range A..B  the blobs introduced by a range of commits. This is the push
                  scope: it costs O(what is being pushed) rather than O(repo),
                  and it still catches content that reached the branch without
                  passing this file at commit time -- a rebase, a cherry-pick,
                  an amend, or a plain `git commit --no-verify`.
  * (no flag)     every tracked file in the working tree. Unchanged, and this is
                  what hosted CI runs: the depth that does not depend on which
                  commits happen to be in front of it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST. The default scope reads the working tree, not
git history. A credential already committed and later removed is still in the
history and this will not find it. That is a separate, one-time job (history
rewrite), not a per-push check, and saying so here is the point: a gate that
quietly implies coverage it does not have is how loop #276 happened in another
form. --range narrows that gap for the commits actually leaving the machine; it
does not close it for history already on the remote.

ALLOWLISTING, because a repo about credentials must be able to write about them.
Two mechanisms, both deliberately narrow:
  * an inline `ci-secret-scan: allow` marker on the same line, which forces the
    author to make the claim at the exact site rather than in a distant config;
  * ops/config/secret-scan-allow.json, for whole paths that are documentation or
    fixtures by construction.
Neither can allowlist a real private-key block — that pattern is unconditional,
because there is no legitimate reason for one to be in this tree at all.

Usage:
    ops/ci-secret-scan.py                 # scan tracked files, exit 1 on a hit
    ops/ci-secret-scan.py --staged        # scan the index, new files included
    ops/ci-secret-scan.py --range A..B    # scan blobs introduced by a range
    ops/ci-secret-scan.py --list-patterns # what it looks for, and why
