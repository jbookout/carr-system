"""reachability-selftest.py — the acceptance suite for ops/reachability-check.py,
written before the check itself (rule e65efc68).

WHAT THE CHECK IS FOR. The 2026-08-23 completion-integrity council's fix D: a
declared control that no live execution path references is not "built", it is a
file. hooks/ledger-boundary-sweep.py has sat in the tree since 2026-08-06 with
its own documentation saying "WRITTEN BUT REGISTERED NOWHERE"; ops/launchd
carries a fleet-sync definition no service declares. Both passed every gate this
repository owns, because every one of them asks whether a thing EXISTS and none
asks whether anything CALLS it.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR, and why it is not the same question. Every case below
runs against a synthetic fixture tree, so it measures THE CHECK and says nothing
whatever about the real inventory — the distinction ops/ci.sh's gates class
already draws for its three inventory checks. The real tree is measured by
running ops/reachability-check.py itself, which ci.sh does in the same class.

THE ONE CASE THAT MATTERS MOST is `unwired_hook_is_a_finding` plus
`tombstone_makes_it_pass`. Together they are the council's confirm-or-kill: if a
declared-but-uncalled control does not fail, the check is not checking
reachability and should be deleted rather than expanded. The three tombstone
INVALIDITY cases exist because a tombstone that can be written carelessly is a
mute button, not a mark: it must carry a reason and a reopen condition, it must
name something that still exists, and it must stop applying the moment the thing
it excuses becomes reachable.

Exit 0 all cases pass, 1 any case fails.
