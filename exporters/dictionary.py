"""record-layer-dictionary.md — the database's own documentation, rendered for humans.

WHY THIS TARGET EXISTS. The migrations write good prose. 38 views live in `public`,
24 of them carry a COMMENT ON, and 27 table columns carry one as well, several of
them multi-paragraph explanations of a trap or a ruling (`loop_item.domain` runs to
873 characters). All of it was written to be read. None of it can be: it sits in
`pg_catalog`, reachable only by someone already holding a psql prompt, which is
neither of the two people the writing was for. This target moves that prose to the
one place both partners already read, and recompiles it every night so it cannot go
stale the way a hand-copied reference would.

THE PART THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE PROSE is the populated fraction beside each
column. The independent audit of 2026-08-02 had to go and MEASURE that `last_touch`
was empty on every lead and every vendor. It was findable only because someone went
looking. Rendered here it becomes a standing number that re-derives itself on every
export, so the next version of that finding shows up on its own instead of waiting
for the next audit.

NO CLIENT DATA. THIS IS A HARD CONSTRAINT AND IT IS ENFORCED IN CODE, NOT INTENDED.
This file renders structure into a document two people read and Drive syncs. Three
rules hold the line:

  1. Every number about live rows comes back from `count()`. `_coverage` builds a
     select of nothing but count expressions and then ASSERTS every value it got
     back is an int. A later edit that slips a plain column into that select raises
     and fails the A8 gate rather than printing somebody's name into the vault.
  2. The only place a row VALUE is read is VOCABULARIES below, a literal tuple of
     seven reference tables. A vocabulary row IS the legal value ('under_loi',
     'roster'), so it carries no person, practice, address, deal or dollar. Because
     the tuple is a literal, no table can join it by being discovered at runtime.
  3. Everything else is catalog: relation names, column names, types, and the prose
     humans typed into COMMENT ON.
  4. THE COMMENT PROSE IS RENDERED VERBATIM, and that is the one place a name can
     reach this file, because a migration author is free to name a real example in
     their own documentation. One does today: 0056's note on `v_ref_index` cites
     "17 live Henry Schein rows" to explain the bug it fixed. That is authored
     documentation, not a row read out of the record, and it goes no further than
     the migration already does — this file lands in `DNA/`, which is exactly the
     Joe-and-Dell share, and both of them already see every one of those rows in
     vendors.xlsx. Nothing here is redacted, because redacting an author's own
     sentence would leave a note that no longer says what it meant. Anyone writing
     a COMMENT ON should know it renders here.

  Verified 2026-08-02 against 3,354 live values (name, org, email, phone) pulled
  from v_export_vendors, v_export_leads, v_export_clients, v_export_deals and
  v_ref_index: one match, the authored "Henry Schein" above. No email address, no
  phone number and no dollar figure appears anywhere in the render.

WHERE IT LANDS, and why. `DNA/Team/` is the shared tier's how-this-works shelf —
dna-protocol.md, twin-system-playbook.md, the record-layer maps, and the adoption
runbook Dell is pointed at on day one. A dictionary of the record is the same kind
of thing those files are, and it is shared-tier by nature: both partners read the
same record and both hit the same "what does status = 'roster' mean" question.
DNA/Reference/ was the other candidate and is wrong — that shelf is market
knowledge (the vertical guides), read while working a deal, not while working the
system.
