    the cutoff without its result depending on which day production fired it.
    ops/vault-drift-watch-selftest.py builds a FIXTURE vault whose registry file
    is DNA/compiled-rules-shared.md; once the real flag went true its six
    registry-path cases started failing against a live config value they never

    # blast radius, not diagnosis, and narrowing it to OSError would let the next
    # unexpected exception type re-open the exact hole this closes.
