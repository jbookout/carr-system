    are over. Non-md targets (xlsx working sheets, json feeds, html boards)

    dead config lookup can never silently kill the render fleet pre-cutoff.

    the cutoff without its result depending on which day production fired it.
    ops/vault-drift-watch-selftest.py builds a FIXTURE vault whose registry file
    is DNA/compiled-rules-shared.md; once the real flag went true its six
    registry-path cases started failing against a live config value they never
    meant to read. The hook lives HERE, in the one function every caller shares,
