/**
 * Typed capability seams for backends V5-J101 depends on but that are not
 * built yet: V5-F01 (canonical record homes), V5-J102 (typed lifecycle),
 * V5-A01 (truthful health projection). Source: architecture_or_design
 * instruction for V5-J101 — "choose between typed client seams that show an
 * honest 'unavailable' state and mocks. Never ship mocks as live behaviour."
 *
 * TWO RULES a seam must follow, both violated in an earlier draft and fixed
 * after independent review of PR #1259 (a seam is a READ about availability,
 * never a WRITE that performs the thing it is checking for):
 *
 *   1. A capability that happens to share a NAME or a RELATED existing call
 *      with a not-yet-built slice is not that slice. getDeal() is the
 *      pre-existing WO-1 Deal Room read, not the V5-F01 canonical
 *      cross-entity record-home surface — its presence must never be read as
 *      F01 being available. recordHomeSeam never falls back to getDeal();
 *      it answers only from a dedicated V5-F01 client binding
 *      (client.getRecordHome), wired once V5-F01 shipped its live read verb
 *      (PR #1263, read-record-source-authority / ops.f01_read).
 *   2. Checking "can this write happen" must never BE the write. lifecycleSeam
 *      only inspects whether client.transitionLifecycle exists as a function;
 *      it never invokes it. (healthSeam and, when F01 ships, recordHomeSeam,
 *      may safely perform their own real READS — reads have no side effect to
 *      leak — but no seam here may perform a write.)
