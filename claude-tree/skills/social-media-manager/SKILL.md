description: Executes the CALENDAR/BATCH side of Joe Bookout's individual social media presence (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook) — refreshing the content calendar, generating visuals, publishing via the Blotato API, and logging published posts and their live URLs. Defers all actual voice/copy drafting to the `write-content` skill; does not draft in its own voice. Use when asked to refresh/generate the next batch of calendar rows, prep a calendar row for publishing, publish a post, or check the social content calendar. For a single one-off post written fresh, use `write-content` instead.

# CARR Social Media Manager

> **Doctrine ownership: single writer.** One seat edits this file, the Fable design seat. Every other session, either brain, proposes changes through the `teach` verb or a team-board row, and the seat lands them. Set 2026-08-01 per ORDER 38 (two-writer endgame D3).

**Reconciled with `write-content` on 2026-07-02.** These two skills used to overlap (both could draft copy and generate visuals) with `write-content` carrying the actual voice work — a real interview with Joe plus three rounds of live feedback — and this skill still running on an older, generic pillar-mix draft style and blind Canva quote-card prompts. That's now split cleanly: **`write-content` owns all voice, copy drafting, and platform judgment calls. This skill owns calendar bookkeeping, visual generation, publishing, and logging.** This skill never invents post copy on its own anymore — see Workflow step 1.

Automates steps 3–5 of `Marketing/Social Media/social-media-workflow.md` (visuals, publishing, logging) using Blotato for actual publishing. Steps 1–2 (weekly topic planning, drafting) are handled by `write-content`, not here.

**Read these before doing anything else, every time this skill runs:**
- `write-content`'s `SKILL.md` — the actual voice rules (I vs. we per platform, hot-takes gating, platform audience definitions, tone). Any copy that ends up in the calendar or gets published must follow these, not the pillar-mix description below.
- `DNA/Marketing/Social Media/content-inspiration-bank.md` — **mandatory, same as it is for `write-content`.** Real substance (Section 2), inspiration/reference patterns (Section 1), and current visual-style guidance (Section 3) live here. Do not draft from a hypothetical/invented scenario, or generate a blind generic quote card, if this file has real material to use instead — that's exactly what got the first live-account test batch rejected on 2026-07-01.
- `DNA/brand-voice.md` — visual identity (navy `#002F6C` / orange `#F57F29`, Oswald/Montserrat), messaging pillars. Colors/fonts still apply; voice guidance here is superseded by `write-content`.
- `Marketing/Social Media/CARR_Social_Media_Strategy.docx` — platform roles, cadence (LinkedIn 3x/wk, Facebook 2x/wk, Instagram 2x/wk, Twitter/X 2x/wk), pillar mix (40% Educational, 30% Local Market, 30% Brand/BTS) — cadence and pillar targets still apply; the pillar mix is a planning target, not a copy template.
- `Marketing/Social Media/CARR_Social_Media_Content_Calendar.xlsx` — the source of truth for *what topic goes on what date/platform*. Columns: `Date, Day, Platform, Pillar, Core Topic, Post Copy (Draft), Visual / Asset Needed, CTA, Status`. Status values: `Planned → Graphic Ready → Posted`. **Caution:** rows drafted before 2026-07-02 used the old generic voice — treat existing `Post Copy (Draft)` text as a topic placeholder only, and re-draft it through `write-content` before it goes any further, rather than publishing it as-is.
- `DNA/Marketing/Brand Assets/asset-checklist.md` — check what real logo/photo assets exist before defaulting to a generated graphic.

Social voice ≠ outreach voice. Do not pull language from `DNA/templates.md` (that's 1:1 email/DM voice) into public posts. These are Joe's individual accounts only — Dell McCraney runs his own accounts separately; this skill and `write-content` both cover Joe's presence only.

**HIPAA guardrail:** never include patient data, patient-identifying photography, heat maps, or demographic studies in social content. If a request touches any of that, stop and flag it rather than proceeding.

## Workflow

### 1. Figure out what's being asked
- **"Refresh the calendar / generate the next batch of rows"** → read the calendar to find where rows run out. For each new row: set `Date, Day, Platform, Pillar, Core Topic, Visual / Asset Needed, CTA` per the cadence/pillar-mix targets above, but **do not write real post copy into `Post Copy (Draft)` yourself.** Instead, either (a) invoke `write-content` for each row's topic/platform and use its output, pulling real substance from `content-inspiration-bank.md` Section 2 rather than inventing a scenario, or (b) leave `Post Copy (Draft)` as a one-line topic placeholder and flag to Joe that copy still needs to run through `write-content`. Set Status to `Planned`.

**Adversarial batch check (added July 2, 2026, batch refreshes only):** `write-content`'s own Pre-Delivery Self-Check is run by the same context that just wrote each post — fine for a single one-off post, since Joe reviews it directly before anything publishes. A full batch refresh (10+ rows at once) is the higher-risk case: more volume, less per-item attention from Joe on any single row, and the same context grading its own work across every row rather than a fresh set of eyes on each one. Once every row in the batch has been drafted through `write-content`, **suggest to Joe that this batch get one adversarial pass from a dispatched subagent** before presenting it. Retrieve rule `2dbb0ad8` through standing-context before applying the cost gate. Source: the recorded Loop Engineering research and later conference corroboration; the writer-never-grades principle applies to high-volume batches.

**Batch review surface (added July 12, 2026):** when presenting a full batch for Joe's greenlight, render ONE HTML preview page (via Artifact) instead of a markdown wall. Apply the active design-variant rule retrieved through standing-context.

- **"Prep post(s) for publishing"** → pick the row(s) (by date, platform, or "next up"). If the row's copy hasn't been through `write-content` yet, do that first — don't publish pre-2026-07-02 placeholder copy. Then generate the visual per step 2 below, and present the copy + visual to Joe. Set Status to `Graphic Ready` once both exist.
- **"Publish [post]"** → run the publish flow below. **Never call the Blotato create-post step without an explicit go-ahead from Joe on that specific post's final copy and visual.** If scheduled for later, create a dated loop through `add-loop`; every session queries that queue through `today-triage`/`loop-board`, so nothing scheduled silently bypasses review.

### 2. Visual creation (Canva MCP)
1. Check `DNA/Marketing/Brand Assets/` for a real logo file or approved photo first — prefer a real asset over a recreated one, per the workflow doc.
2. Check `content-inspiration-bank.md` Section 3 for current visual-style guidance before generating anything — as of 2026-07-02 the guidance is: don't do a blind `generate-design` text-prompt quote card (this is what read as boring/template-y in the rejected test batch); prefer pointing Canva at a real reference template or image (`search-brand-templates` / `create-design-from-candidate`) once inspiration examples are logged in Section 1, or compare against Blotato's native image generation as an alternative.
3. **Do not pass a `brand_kit_id`.** Joe's Canva Brand Kit ("Joe Bookout Realtor") is stale/wrong and there's no tool to edit it — spell out the real CARR colors/fonts (navy `#002F6C`, orange `#F57F29`, Oswald/Montserrat) directly in the generation query instead, same as `write-content` does.
4. Export it (`export-design`) to get a URL.
5. **Vision-check every export before presenting or publishing (added July 6, 2026):** view the exported image itself and grade it against the brand colors/fonts above, `content-inspiration-bank.md` Section 3, and basic legibility (no cut-off or garbled text, readable at phone size). A graphic that fails — including one that would blend into any generic real-estate agent's feed (stock skyline, house-and-key icons, headshot-with-phone-number card) — gets regenerated, not presented with a caveat, and nothing publishes sight-unseen.
6. If the row's `Visual / Asset Needed` says "None needed — text post" (common for Twitter/X), skip this entirely.

### 3. Publishing (Blotato API)

> **Pre-schedule gate (Jul 7, 2026):** before ANY post is uploaded or scheduled, verify it passes DNA/brand-voice.md's 6-point **Publication Firewall** (no internal-only material — commission economics, negotiation playbooks, vendor relationship tactics; no named-vendor negativity or rivalry-pair favoritism; competitor criticism structural-only and NEVER on LinkedIn; no client-identifiable content; public-sourced numbers only). A post that fails ANY point holds for Joe — never schedule it planning to fix later.
Source `scripts/blotato.sh` (requires `BLOTATO_API_KEY` set in `~/.zprofile` — never paste the key into a config file, skill file, or chat). Account/page IDs live in `config/blotato-accounts.json`; if a platform's IDs are still `REPLACE_ME`, stop and tell Joe to fill them in before publishing to that platform.

**Note on the Blotato MCP tools:** a separate Cowork session has the Blotato MCP server connected directly (tools prefixed `blotato_*`) and has used it to schedule test posts to these same accounts. Both paths hit the same live Blotato account — if you're checking whether something's already scheduled or published, check both `published-log.md` (this skill's log) and ask whether a Cowork session has scheduled anything recently, since a schedule made via the MCP path won't show up here until it publishes and this skill logs it.

**Note on LinkedIn `pageId`:** Joe's Blotato LinkedIn connection is a personal profile, not a Company Page, and `GET /v2/users/me/accounts/{accountId}/subaccounts` returns empty for it. Blotato's docs don't document the personal-profile case, so `pageId` is currently set to the same value as `accountId` as an untested fallback. If a LinkedIn publish attempt comes back `status: failed`, report the exact `errorMessage` to Joe rather than retrying — it likely means this field needs a different value. **Pre-flight evidence (July 3, 2026):** `blotato_list_accounts` returns `requiredFields: {}` for this LinkedIn account — no pageId is required at all — so the likely correct fix on a failure is *omitting* `pageId` from the target entirely, not finding a different value. Try that first.

1. If there's a visual: `blotato_upload_media_url "<canva export URL>"` → gives a Blotato-hosted media URL.
2. Build the request body for `blotato_create_post` matching the platform:

**LinkedIn**
```json
{ "post": {
    "accountId": "<linkedin.accountId>",
    "content": { "platform": "linkedin", "text": "...", "mediaUrls": ["<url>"] },
    "target": { "targetType": "linkedin", "pageId": "<linkedin.pageId>" }
} }
```

**Facebook**
```json
{ "post": {
    "accountId": "<facebook.accountId>",
    "content": { "platform": "facebook", "text": "...", "mediaUrls": ["<url>"] },
    "target": { "targetType": "facebook", "pageId": "<facebook.pageId>" }
} }
```

**Instagram** (feed post unless the calendar row calls for reel/story; note from July 3, 2026 pre-flight: `blotato_list_accounts` lists `requiredFields: {mediaType: "story|reel"}` for this account — if a plain feed post fails, `mediaType` may need to be set explicitly)
```json
{ "post": {
    "accountId": "<instagram.accountId>",
    "content": { "platform": "instagram", "text": "...", "mediaUrls": ["<url>"] },
    "target": { "targetType": "instagram", "altText": "..." }
} }
```

**Twitter/X** (text-only is fine; omit `mediaUrls` if no graphic)
```json
{ "post": {
    "accountId": "<twitter.accountId>",
    "content": { "platform": "twitter", "text": "..." },
    "target": { "targetType": "twitter" }
} }
```

3. `blotato_create_post body.json` → `postSubmissionId`.
4. `blotato_wait_for_publish "$postSubmissionId"` → poll until `status` is `published` (grab `publicUrl`) or `failed` (report `errorMessage` to Joe and stop — do not retry silently).

### 4. Logging (after a confirmed live publish only)
1. Two logs, two jobs (reconciled July 7, 2026): append the factual publish record to `published-log.md` (Date, Platform, Pillar, Topic, excerpt, publicUrl, calendar row) AND add a row to `post-performance-log.md` carrying the post's **Job tag** (top-of-mind / lead-gen / referral-validation, from write-content), hook/angle, and format — metrics + Learning fill in ~a week later per that file's how-to. published-log = what shipped; post-performance-log = what worked. Don't duplicate metrics into published-log.
2. Flip that row's `Status` to `Posted` in `CARR_Social_Media_Content_Calendar.xlsx` (use `openpyxl`; install via `pip3 install --user openpyxl` if missing).
3. Add a one-line entry to `content-inspiration-bank.md`'s Feedback Log noting what was published and any reaction/engagement worth remembering — this keeps the bank current even for posts that came through the calendar rather than a one-off `write-content` session.

## Relationship to `write-content`
- **`write-content`** — single post, written fresh, on demand. Owns the actual voice/copy/platform judgment. Use for "write me a post about X" or "give me something to post today."
- **This skill** — calendar bookkeeping, visual generation, Blotato publishing, and logging. Use for batch calendar refreshes and the publish step. Calls into `write-content`'s rules for any copy it needs rather than drafting independently.
- Both read `content-inspiration-bank.md` and must not invent hypothetical examples when real substance is available there.

## Files in this skill
- `scripts/blotato.sh` — Blotato API helpers (media upload, create post, poll status).
- `config/blotato-accounts.json` — per-platform Blotato account/page IDs (fill in from the Blotato dashboard; not secret, but keep the API key itself out of this file — that's an env var).
