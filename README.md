# carr-system

Version-controlled code spine of the CARR AI system (Joe Bookout + Dell McCraney, healthcare CRE). Phase 1 of the orchestrator migration, started 2026-07-24.

## Where knowledge lives

This repo holds code only. Doctrine, records, brand, persona and deal context live in the CARR Record Layer (the doctrine store), which is the single source of truth: read it through the MCP connector's verbs, or locally with `./run.sh retrieve "<question>"`.

The Drive cutoff fired 2026-08-19. The generated Drive `.md` files were moved to `_to_delete/md-renders-cutoff-20260819` in the vault, the exporter prints RETIRED instead of rewriting them, and there is no compiled-rules file or vault CLAUDE.md to fall back on. A session that cannot reach the store must stop and say so rather than work from memory. Vault paths such as `DNA/...` that still appear in code comments are historical pointers, not live doctrine.

## Layout

- `manifest.tsv` — one row per repo code file that is still paired with a Drive copy (repo path, then vault path), plus comment lines recording retired pairings and repo-only placements. `tools/check.sh` reads it: by default it checks each row's repo file against committed HEAD; the repo-vs-vault comparison runs only in recovery mode.
- `generators/` — the three board/feed generators (phase 1; repo is their runtime on Joe's Mac since phase 2)
  - `build-deal-room.py` — JSON→HTML Deal Room renderer. Reads `DNA/Team/live-boards/panhandle-team-deals.json`, writes `deal-room-panhandle.html`. NOT the Salesforce-export importer (that is a separate, still-open build — vault open-loops #84).
  - `build-lead-board.py` — the Lead Board builder. Writes `Automation/lead-board.html`.
  - `build-renewal-feed.py` — the renewal-radar feed builder. Writes `Automation/renewal-radar.json`.
- `pipelines/` (+ `pipelines/radar/`) — the rest of the durable pipeline code, imported phase 3 (2026-07-24). REPOINTED to repo runtime (verified identical first): `corroborate.py`, `build-space-search.py` (+ its template asset). Cloud-only fallback copies remain pending an independently verified repoint or retirement: `build-front-door.py`, `build-search-map.py`, `dso-match.py`, and the input-gated radar scripts (PECOS gate: October). Dell's migrated Mac reads this repo and does not use those Drive copies. Deliberately left out of the repo: the demoted Firefly receiver, deal-specific research one-offs, launchd plists.
- `shared/` — code mirrored to the shared DNA tier (lead-board template, vendor intro-path tool, fill-engine pair). The repo is canonical for both partner Macs; Drive copies remain only for cloud-only delivery/runtime until that surface is separately retired.
- `video/` — the video lane's code, imported 2026-07-25 (it had been living untracked at `~/Movies/CARR Video Pipeline/Scripts` since it was built on Jul 22). AE ExtendScript comp builders + their shell/python drivers: lower thirds, stock b-roll clips, the animated-static builder, the watch-folder encoder, the Premiere XML cutter, and the parked CEP panel. Mapped by `manifest-video.tsv`, whose runtime root is `~/Movies/CARR Video Pipeline` rather than the vault — the pipeline lives outside Drive on purpose because media files are large and Drive sync would churn on them, but the CODE still belongs under version control. Repo is the source of truth, `~/Movies` is the runtime, and `run.sh check --recovery --reason WHY` reports drift between them. No output baselines for this lane (video outputs are large binaries and do not belong in git); the review mechanism is the visual pass logged in the pipeline's own `CRITIQUE-LOG.md`. Reasoning and the exclusion list are recorded in the manifest header.
  - Animated statics: `make-animated-static.sh <layers> <name> [--concept K] [--sfx N] [--email] [--dry-run]`, planned by `plan-animated-static.py` against `choreography-log.tsv` so a recent shape is never repeated (7 concepts, 5 landing sounds; one sound per piece, varying between pieces). `--email` adds an Outlook-safe cut: legacy Outlook on Windows renders only a GIF's first frame, so that cut leads with the FINISHED card for one frame and does not loop. Social dosing doctrine is in the doctrine store (two per month, never consecutive weeks, IG/FB only, never X); its former vault path was `Marketing/Social Media/social-media-workflow.md`.
- `bin/` — shell utilities (automation-Chrome launcher, calendar fetcher).
- `baselines/` — committed snapshots of each generator's current output. Any code change must show its output diff against these before being accepted (the checkability guardrail: nobody reads this code line-by-line, so the outputs are what get reviewed). The two PII-bearing outputs (`lead-board.html`, `deal-room-panhandle.html`) are hash-only tracked since ORDER 42b (2026-08-06) — see the Boundaries section.
- `tools/check.sh` — `run.sh check`. Default mode: every manifest row committed at HEAD, export receipts, the Lead Board fork declaration, and registry integrity. Vault code drift, video-runtime drift and output drift vs baselines run only under `--recovery --reason WHY` (optionally `--vault PATH`).
- `tools/health-check.py` — the rule-28 façade check as code (phase 3 pilot): every watched pipeline output tested for STALE-past-cadence and BEHIND-its-inputs. `run.sh health`; the daily heartbeat's JOB 4a calls it.
- `tools/writing-lint.py` — the writing rules (now in the doctrine store; formerly `DNA/writing-rules.md`) as a deterministic gate (2026-07-25). `run.sh lint <file> [--surface email|social|proposal|web]`. HARD findings are hard bans with a per-instance signature (any hit fails, exit 1); REVIEW findings are hard-ban rules whose pattern has legitimate CRE uses (land, leverage-the-noun, landscape, shift) and always need a human; RATION covers the one-per-piece filler adverbs. It does NOT replace the `writing-audit` skill's judgment pass — it precedes it, the same way the ban list precedes the judgment checks inside writing-rules.md. Fixtures in `tools/fixtures/` are the contract: `clean-email.txt` must stay 0 HARD (false-positive guard), `dirty-social.txt` must keep catching every planted tell (detection guard); both are baselined and checked by `run.sh check`. When the writing rules gain a rule, add it here in the same edit and re-run `tools/writing-lint-baseline.sh`.

## Execution model (phase 2 live, 2026-07-24)

**On both partner Macs this repo is the code runtime.** Joe's primary machine runs the scheduled pipelines; Dell's migrated secondary has no CARR AI vault mounted and runs no primary-only scheduled tasks. Normal `./run.sh deal-room|lead-board|all` paths use canonical record inputs and fail closed when they are unavailable. `renewal-feed` remains an explicit recovery-only MLS-file command until canonical MLS ingress exists; Drive use requires `--recovery --reason WHY` (and optional `--vault PATH`), while normal mode ignores ambient `CARR_VAULT`.

**The vault code copies are not a runtime on either partner Mac.** The rows left in `manifest.tsv` pair repo code with a cloud-only delivery fallback copy in Drive; those copies stay until that surface has a verified replacement or retirement, and are never doctrine. Change flow:

1. Edit the script here (branch + PR if you're Dell's side — see access model).
2. Run `tools/check.sh`. Comparing against the Drive copies and vault outputs is recovery-only: `tools/check.sh --recovery --reason WHY`.
3. When a change is accepted: run the pipeline via `run.sh`, verify the output diff is exactly the intended change, update the baseline, copy the script to its vault path only if its manifest row still pairs it with a Drive fallback, and commit baseline + code together.

## Access model (Joe's decision, 2026-07-24)

- Joe: owner, merges everything. Joe is the code-savvy partner; every fix lands through him.
- Dell's side: authenticated access to the private repo is live. Dell works on a named branch, pushes that branch, and opens a PR; Joe reviews and merges. The installed pre-push hook refuses Dell's direct pushes to `main` and preserves the review gate.
- Platform-enforced branch protection on a private repo still requires the appropriate paid GitHub plan. Until then, the local pre-push hook plus Joe-owned merge is the active control.

## Boundaries

- This repo is PRIVATE and stays private. It is not, however, where client PII is meant to live: prospect/client PII never lives in GitHub (Joe's ruling (a), 2026-08-01; ORDER 42). The two output baselines that used to carry it in full — `baselines/lead-board.html` (~60,687 emails / 218 phones) and `baselines/deal-room-panhandle.html` (91/49) — moved to hash-only tracking under ORDER 42b (2026-08-06): the full HTML stays LOCAL and gitignored, only its sha256 is committed (`baselines/SHA256SUMS`); see `tools/check.sh`. `backups/*.sql.age` (encrypted full DB dumps) likewise moved out of git to the R2 archive under ORDER 42b; see `bin/backup-dump.sh` and `lib/r2_archive.py`. History predating ORDER 42b's purge may still carry these — see `ops/order42b-history-purge.md` for the purge status. The partner boundary is open (Joe and Dell share all client details); the external publication firewall is absolute.
- Nothing in this repo sends anything external. Generators write local files/artifacts only. Claude drafts, Joe sends — the permanent gate.

## Working-tree hygiene (2026-08-08)

Several sessions share this one checkout, so its state is shared state.

- **Claim before you branch.** `git checkout -b` moves HEAD for every session
  in this tree; commits then land on whichever branch someone else chose
  (rule 308ef1de). Prefer `git worktree add --detach <path> origin/main` for
  isolated work — it never moves shared HEAD, and two sessions can hold one
  each. A worktree cannot check out a branch another worktree holds, which is
  why detached is the reliable form.
- **`dictation-phase-b-loop-243` is POISONED and cannot be pushed.** One
  commit on it (6871583) carries `tools/doc-convo/.venv-qwen`, 8,244 files
  including a 155MB binary, and GitHub's pre-receive declines any push
  containing that blob. Nothing of value is trapped: its source was replayed
  byte-identical onto `codex-doc-convo-clean`, everything else is on `main`
  or on `origin/dictation-phase-b-loop-243` (which is blob-free). Whoever
  next works in this tree should clear it:

      git switch -C dictation-phase-b-loop-243 origin/dictation-phase-b-loop-243

  That drops two commits, both already preserved on remotes, and deletes the
  venv from disk — regenerable, which is why this was left for the tree's
  next occupant rather than done across lanes.
- **Never commit build output or environments.** `.build/` (Swift) and
  `.venv*/` (Python) are gitignored as of today, after 274 Swift artifacts
  and one 155MB venv were committed by broad `git add` calls. Add paths
  deliberately; `git add <dir>` sweeps whatever is sitting in it.
- **Untracked is not saved.** Two files lived all day as untracked local
  copies with no commit on any ref, one `git clean -fd` from gone. If a file
  matters, commit it the day it is written.
