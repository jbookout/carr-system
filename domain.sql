-- DoctorCRE V5-F01 — authoritative record homes, source authority and document
-- identity: the DOMAIN SCHEMA ONLY.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS. The additive `ops` relations and security-definer functions
-- that the F01 handlers write through, plus the structural constraints that make
-- the nine settled decisions properties of the DATABASE rather than promises in
-- a handler. It is domain DDL and nothing else.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT, and the parent must supply separately:
--   * A migration. There is no migration number, no ledger entry, no SCAC
--     registration and no ordinal reservation here. Security attribution owns
--     0499/v25; the F01 successor is v26 and the parent binds it.
--   * Policy. No field owner, write direction, retention period, governing
--     constraint, surviving derivative, hold, Salesforce mapping, OneDrive item
--     or object-storage key is inserted, defaulted or implied. Every registry
--     row arrives through ops.f01_install_policy from a humanOnly plus
--     authorityOnly tool path, and this file ships zero rows of it.
--   * Legacy change. public.record_source and public.document are not read,
--     altered, backfilled, renamed, dual-written or referenced. Nothing here
--     claims a bridge from a legacy row to an F01 identity.
--   * External effect. No provider call, no byte deletion, no notification, no
--     scheduler, no extension install, no role creation.
--
-- THREE STRUCTURAL PROMISES, each enforced rather than documented:
--
--   1. SEPARATION. Current state, append-only events, mutation receipts and
--      reconciliation items are four different relations. ops.f01_apply_observation
--      refuses a shape where one stands in for another.
--   2. RECOMPUTED INTEGRITY. Every stored record carries the exact canonical
--      preimage it hashes to, and the digest column is bound to a CHECK that
--      recomputes it from that preimage inside PostgreSQL. The database never
--      learns a digest from the caller; it agrees with one or refuses.
--   3. NO DIRECT DML. Every F01 relation carries a guard trigger that refuses an
--      INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE that did not arrive through a registered
--      ops.f01_* writer, and every history relation additionally refuses UPDATE,
--      DELETE and TRUNCATE outright.
--
-- REQUIRES PostgreSQL 13 or later: trim_scale() (canonical numbers), the
-- built-in sha256(bytea) (digests) and gen_random_uuid() are all assumed.
--
-- SEARCH PATH. Every function pins `SET search_path = pg_catalog, ops, public`
-- and every object reference below is schema-qualified anyway, so a caller's
-- session search_path can never select a different table or operator.

-- REQUIRES A UTF8 DATABASE. The canonical bytes below are UTF-8 by definition —
-- they have to be, because the Node side hashes UTF-8 — so a database in any
-- other encoding would silently hash different bytes for the same record. That
-- is exactly the drift the readback contract exists to prevent, so it is a hard
-- stop at install time rather than a surprise at comparison time. It is also
-- what lets ops.f01_digest_jsonb be declared IMMUTABLE and used inside CHECK
-- constraints: with the encoding fixed, convert_to is deterministic.

--
-- These four functions reproduce mcp-server/src/artifact-trust.js canonicalJson

-- the two directly; the database never learns the expected bytes from itself.
--
-- canonicalJson's rules, restated so the correspondence is checkable:
--   array   [ items joined by "," ]
--   object  { "key":value pairs joined by "," }, keys sorted by JavaScript's
--           default Array.prototype.sort — that is UTF-16 CODE UNIT order, not
--           code point order. The two differ only for astral characters, which
--           is why f01_utf16_sortkey exists rather than a plain ORDER BY key.
--   string  JSON.stringify: escape " and \, the five short escapes, \u00xx in
--           lower-case hex below 0x20, and every other character literally —
--           including U+007F, which JSON.stringify does NOT escape.

-- 3. The authenticated principal.
--
-- DERIVED FROM THE CONNECTION, NEVER ACCEPTED FROM THE CALLER. The actor comes
-- from session_user — the database principal the connection actually
-- authenticated as — and, for the two authority principals, from the existing
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() helper, resolved dynamically so this schema stays
-- additive and never redefines a function it does not own.
--
-- session_user AND NOT current_user, deliberately. SECURITY DEFINER changes
-- current_user and leaves session_user alone, so the definer writers below
-- cannot launder their own caller into an authority: the principal these
-- functions see is the one that opened the connection, whatever frame asks.
--
-- NO GUC CONFERS AUTHORITY. carr.acting_actor_slug is ATTRIBUTION ONLY. It is
-- read for the ordinary writer principal alone, where it names which sponsored
-- agent is acting behind an already-sponsored connection, and it is checked
-- against the same slug shape as every other actor. Setting it — to 'joe' or to
-- anything else — cannot make a session human, cannot make it a verified
-- partner, and cannot reach either authorityOnly surface.
--
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() IS A DEPENDENCY, NOT A FALLBACK. When it is absent
-- the authority path raises f01_authority_actor_slug_missing rather than
-- degrading to session_user, to current_user or to the schema owner. An
-- unbootstrapped database refuses authority work; it does not quietly hand that
-- authority to whoever installed the schema. Without the guard the same
-- situation surfaces as a bare "function does not exist" from PL/pgSQL's
-- deferred name resolution, which reads like a packaging accident rather than
-- the hard stop it is.
--
-- PARENT WIRING (see the file-foot notes): the four role names below are the
-- principals this schema assumes. The parent must confirm them, and must confirm
-- that ops.authority_actor_slug() exists and returns a slug matching the shape
-- asserted here for each authority role.
--
-- WHERE THAT HELPER COMES FROM, and what it obliges the parent to have done.
-- ops.authority_actor_slug() is defined by the canonical control-plane authority
-- boundary — 0161_control_plane_authority_boundary.sql — as a SECURITY DEFINER,
-- STABLE function that CASEs on session_user, returning 'joe' for
-- carr_authority_joe and 'dell' for carr_authority_dell and raising for anyone
-- else. That migration also revokes it from PUBLIC and grants EXECUTE on it to
-- the NOLOGIN group role carr_authority. This file does not redefine it, regrant
-- it, or wrap it; it depends on it.
--
-- TWO CALLERS REACH IT, UNDER TWO DIFFERENT ROLES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE:
--
--   * ops.f01_context_actor_slug() below is SECURITY DEFINER, so it — and every
--     definer writer that resolves a principal through it — reaches the helper
--     as the SCHEMA OWNER. The owner must therefore own the helper or be a
--     member of carr_authority. The grant loop at the foot of this file cannot
--     supply that and must not try: the helper is not an f01\_% object and does
--     not belong to this capsule.
--   * ops.f01_require_authority_principal() below is CALLER-RIGHTS, so an
--     authority login calling it directly reaches the helper as ITSELF, over the
--     grant carr_authority already holds. That is why the two authority logins
--     must be members of that group role.
--
-- BOTH ANSWER IDENTICALLY, because the helper derives from session_user and
-- SECURITY DEFINER changes only current_user. Adding SECURITY DEFINER to
-- f01_require_authority_principal would change no answer at all; it would only
-- move which role needs the helper grant, and quietly drop the one path that
-- exercises the login's own privilege. The fixture asserts the two derivations
-- agree rather than assuming it.

-- WHOSE RULE THIS RELATION SERVES, said once here and referred to below rather
-- than repeated. Q129.D1 settles the per-class RETENTION REGISTRY and nothing
-- about provenance registration. The registration rule this table exists for was
-- approved in native task 01a0869f-fe0d-7493-bda3-ab8b3c0d6683, user turn
-- 01a08779-6b68-7013-bab1-369cf616254f, and carries no canonical decision id
-- because none was issued for it. Where the comments below say "the approved
-- registration rule" they mean that and only that; nothing here is a new settled
-- decision and nothing downstream should record it as one.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS. One trusted producer workflow's record that it created one
-- derived record from one stored artifact: when the system makes a lease
-- abstract, the row says which lease produced it. Nobody types it; the producing
-- workflow writes it in the same transaction that produces the derivative, which
-- is what "before the derivative is considered complete" means in practice.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS NOT, and the CHECK below makes it unsayable. It is not an
-- inventory. The presence of rows tells you what was registered; the ABSENCE of
-- rows tells you nothing at all, because an unregistered derivative — from a
-- workflow written before this rule, from a provider, from a copy somebody made
-- — leaves exactly the same trace as no derivative: none. So every stored link
-- carries registration_is_provenance = true, is_exhaustive_inventory = false,
-- establishes_coverage = false and permits_deletion = false inside the bytes it
-- hashes to, and a row claiming otherwise — or a row SAYING NOTHING EITHER WAY —
-- cannot be inserted at all.
--
-- WHAT A ROW HERE IS ALSO NOT: A CHECKED FACT ABOUT THE DERIVATIVE. Nothing in
-- this schema loads, or could load, the record named by derivative_id /
-- derivative_content_digest. The foreign key binds the SOURCE side only, so a
-- registration is a producer's ATTESTATION that it made something, not the
-- database's knowledge that the something exists. Today that is harmless in the
-- one direction it can go — an attested derivative only ever blocks a deletion
-- harder, and no coverage answer can be established at all — but it stops being
-- harmless the moment coverage could be established, because an attested-only
-- link would then flow through ops.f01_stored_derivatives into a deletion
-- receipt as a named survivor that may never have existed. So it is a standing
-- precondition on that work rather than a footnote: DO NOT BUILD AN INGRESS
-- THAT ESTABLISHES COVERAGE UNTIL PRODUCER OUTPUTS ARE INDEPENDENTLY BOUND AND
-- VERIFIED — the derivative resolvable and its bytes checked against
-- derivative_content_digest by something other than the registering caller.
-- Nothing in this file supplies that, and nothing here pretends to.
--
-- ONE DERIVATIVE HAS ONE ORIGINAL. The identity index is on (kind, id) rather
-- than on (source, kind, id): re-registering the same derivative against a
-- different artifact is not a second provenance edge, it is a rewrite of where
-- the derivative came from, and it refuses.

-- put two copies of one predicate in one file, and the copy that drifts is always
-- the one nobody is looking at.
--
-- WHAT IT MAKES IMPOSSIBLE. A stored link that claims to be an inventory, to
-- establish coverage or to permit deletion — and, equally, one that SAYS NOTHING
-- EITHER WAY. The second half is why coalesce is here: `->>` over an ABSENT key
-- yields SQL NULL, NULL = 'false' is NULL, and a CHECK fails only on FALSE, so an
-- earlier form of this refused a record asserting establishes_coverage: true and
-- ADMITTED one that simply omitted the key — leaving a stored link with no
-- self-limiting bytes for a later reader to find. '' is neither 'true' nor
-- 'false', so silence now fails the same conjunct a contrary claim does.
--
-- NOT VALID, AND THE COMMENT SAYS WHAT THAT MEANS RATHER THAN IMPLYING MORE. Rows
-- written before this tightening are NOT re-checked and are NOT retro-verified:
-- the constraint binds every row inserted from here on, and says nothing about
-- what is already stored. A validating form would abort the whole apply on the
-- first pre-existing row that omitted a key — which is precisely the row this
-- exists to make impossible in future, and precisely the row an operator needs
-- the schema to still install so they can go and look at it.

 * WHETHER THE REGISTERED LINKS FOR ONE ARTIFACT ARE THE WHOLE SET.
 *
 * THIS FUNCTION RETURNS 'unknown' FOR EVERY ARTIFACT, ON PURPOSE, AND SAYING SO
 * PLAINLY IS THE POINT OF IT. Registered links prove what WAS registered. To
 * know that they are ALL the derivatives, two further facts would have to be
 * established, and this slice has an ingress for neither:
 *
 *   (a) A CLOSED PRODUCER SET. Which trusted producer workflows may derive from
 *       this artifact's class at all. Without it, "no other links exist" and "no
 *       other producer has run yet" are indistinguishable.
 *   (b) A REGISTERED COMPLETION FROM EVERY ONE OF THEM for this exact artifact,
 *       so that each named producer has positively said it is finished with it
 *       rather than merely having written nothing so far.
 *
 * Neither may be asserted by a caller, and neither is inferable from row counts:
 * an empty ops.f01_derivative_link is exactly what an artifact with no
 * derivatives AND an artifact whose producers never registered anything both
 * look like. So the honest answer is 'unknown', the honest consequence is that
 * ops.f01_stored_derivatives below returns NULL and every deletion evaluation
 * fails closed, and the way to change that answer is to build (a) and (b) — not
 * to flip a flag here.
 *
 *   (c) AND A THIRD, WHICH IS NOT OPTIONAL EITHER. A registered link is its
 *       producer's attestation that a derivative exists; nothing loads the named
 *       derivative or checks its bytes against derivative_content_digest, and the
 *       foreign key binds the source side only. While the state is 'unknown' that
 *       costs nothing — an attested link only ever blocks a deletion harder. The
 *       moment 'established' becomes reachable it stops being free, because the
 *       kinds here flow into ops.f01_stored_derivatives and out into a deletion
 *       receipt as named survivors. So: coverage may not be established until
 *       producer outputs are INDEPENDENTLY BOUND AND VERIFIED, by something other
 *       than the caller that registered them. This is a precondition on that
 *       work, not a caveat about it.
 *
 * The observed links ARE returned alongside, because they are real evidence and
 * a reader should be able to see them; they are simply not a coverage claim.

-- 9. The writers.
--
-- Each one derives its actor, validates the tenant, serializes by natural
-- identity, enforces its compare-and-swap, verifies every digest it is handed by
-- RECOMPUTING it, and returns a readback rebuilt from the committed-shape row in
-- the same transaction. None of them accepts an actor, a tenant, a clock or a
-- prior state from its caller.
--
-- REPLAY BEFORE STATE. Every writer below calls ops.f01_claim_idempotency — and
-- therefore ops.f01_replay_outcome — BEFORE it reads any current pointer or
-- evaluates any compare-and-swap. That ordering is load-bearing rather than
-- incidental: a settled key must return its stored result even though the world
-- has moved on since, and a replay that ran after the CAS would raise
-- f01_stale_* for a request that had already succeeded. Do not hoist a state
-- read, a CAS or a policy comparison above the claim.
--
-- THE LOCK HIERARCHY, and it is acyclic. Every advisory lock any writer takes
-- appears in exactly one tier, and no writer ever takes a lock from a lower tier
-- before one from a higher tier. A new writer, or a new lock in an existing one,
-- MUST slot into this order or the deadlock freedom below stops being true.
--
--   tier 1  f01:request:<tenant>:<key>            (f01_replay_outcome; shared
--           with the private claim, and re-entrant within one transaction, so a
--           caller that probes for a replay and then writes does not self-block)
--   tier 2  f01:policy:<tenant>                   (exclusive in f01_install_policy;
--           SHARED in f01_apply_observation, f01_record_proposal and
--           f01_record_deletion_evaluation, which read the policy but never move it)
--   tier 3  f01:field:<tenant>:<entity>:<field>   (f01_apply_observation)
--           f01:artifact:<identity tuple>         (f01_record_artifact)
--           f01:document:<tenant>:<document_id>   (f01_record_document)
--           f01:artifact-retention:<tenant>:<artifact digest>
--                                                 (f01_record_hold,
--           f01_record_deletion_evaluation AND f01_register_derivative_link —
--           deliberately the SAME key for all three, so that neither a hold nor
--           a derivative registration can land underneath a deletion evaluation
--           that has already read the inventory and the coverage it will be
--           bound to. f01_record_proposal takes it too, because it registers a
--           derivative link of its own)
--   tier 4  f01:hold:<tenant>:<hold_id>           (f01_record_hold)
--           f01:derivative:<tenant>:<kind>:<id>   (f01_register_derivative_link
--                                                  and f01_record_proposal)
--
-- Tier 3 keys are mutually disjoint and no writer takes two of them, so the
-- observed acquisition orders are exactly 1→2, 1→2→3, 1→2→3→4, 1→3 and 1→3→4.
-- Tier 4 keys are disjoint from each other and no writer takes two of them
-- either. There is no edge from a lower tier back to a higher one, hence no
-- cycle, hence no deadlock between any two F01 writers.
--
-- ONE CLAIM PER TRANSACTION-TIER-1 KEY. f01_record_proposal writes a derivative
-- link through the PRIVATE ops.f01_insert_derivative_link rather than by calling
-- the public writer, precisely so that it does not take a second tier-1 request
-- lock after a tier-2 policy lock. Its own idempotency key already covers both
-- records: they are written in one transaction and replayed as one outcome.

-- 10. Grants.
--
-- NO DIRECT RUNTIME DML, anywhere. The runtime principal receives EXECUTE on the
-- nine operation functions and SELECT on the relations for diagnosis; every
-- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE arrives through a security-definer writer
-- or does not arrive at all.
--
-- PARENT WIRING. The runtime role name below is the one thing this file cannot
-- know from inside the capsule. The DO block applies the grants only to roles
-- that already exist and creates none, so the migration is additive and safe to
-- apply before the parent confirms the exact name.
--
-- THE READER'S EXCLUSION LIST IS TEN NAMES AND IT IS MIRRORED IN THREE PLACES:
-- here, in the posture readback in section 11, in the SQL fixture's
-- least-privilege block, and in the local PostgreSQL gate's READER_FORBIDDEN.
-- The eight writers are the obvious part; f01_replay_outcome and
-- f01_require_authority_principal are the two that a mirror written from the
-- writer list alone will miss, and a mirror that misses them fails a CORRECT
-- schema. Anything added to or removed from this list has to move in all four.
--
-- f01_register_derivative_link is a WRITER, so the reader is excluded from it
-- like the rest; carr_writer KEEPS it, because the ordinary evidence principal
-- is exactly the trusted producer identity the settled decision names.
-- f01_insert_derivative_link is a PRIVATE helper and joins the claim/settle pair
-- that nobody may execute at runtime.
