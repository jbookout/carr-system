"""loadpy — import a Python file whose name is not a legal module name.

Most of this repo's operational scripts are hyphenated (ops/vault-drift-watch.py,
ops/store-markup-scan.py), which `import` cannot spell. Seven files had each
grown their own copy of the same importlib incantation:

    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name, path)
    mod  = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    spec.loader.exec_module(mod)

Three lines, three latent faults, repeated seven times. spec_from_file_location
returns None for a path that does not exist or is not importable, and spec.loader
is itself optional — so a typo'd or moved path did not fail with "no such file",
it failed with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'exec_module'`
somewhere inside a selftest, at 2am, in a log nobody reads until morning. That is
also what the type-check tripwire was reporting: 21 of its 47 errors on
2026-08-14 were those three lines in seven files.

One helper, one error message that names the file it could not load.
