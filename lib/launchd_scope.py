# RUNS ON EXACTLY ONE MACHINE. Not a statement about Joe; a statement about what
# the job writes. Each of these mutates state that is SHARED between the two
# machines, so a second copy is either duplicated work or a two-writer conflict.
# Widened 2026-08-10 during the Dell migration audit, when the set held only the
# video pipeline and the other five would have been installed on his Mac:
#
#   videopipeline       — Joe's Movies folder; Dell has no video pipeline.
#   nightly-record-layer— pushes the corpus to the shared vault and mirrors
#                         doctrine to a path hardcoded to Joe's Google Drive
#                         (bin/nightly.sh:154), which cannot resolve on another
#                         machine. The cadence engine inside it IS idempotent,
#                         so the risk is the vault writes, not double-spawning.
#   rules-refresh       — writes the shared compiled-rules renders, and the cost
#                         ruling in its own plist is decisive: Neon free is
#                         100 CU-h/month at ~5 min per wake, so a second Mac
#                         waking it hourly doubles the burn and can SUSPEND the
#                         database for the rest of the month.
#   local-briefs        — maintains Joe's local review queue. Legacy brief files
#                         are explicit recovery only; a second scheduler would
#                         duplicate the same owner-specific maintenance.
#   partner-ping        — writes the shared record. One pinger is the point.
#   cutover-watch       — writes the shared record (a loop update on #532) and
#                         holds its own sentinel of what it last reported under
#                         out/cutover-watch/, which is per-machine and would
#                         make two Macs disagree about what is "new" — the
#                         same partner-ping shape (one watcher, one shared
#                         record) with the added risk of two update-loop calls
#                         racing on the same loop's base_version.
#   canary-ingest-sink  — Joe's machine-local canary destination for the
#                         notes-sweep CANARY; a second Mac standing up its own
#                         copy would give the canary tier two different
#                         "isolated" endpoints to disagree about, not defense
#                         in depth.
#
# What the second machine still needs from the nightly is the record-derived
# fetch allowlist, which is per-machine and gitignored. That is why
# com.carr.fetch-allowlist.plist exists as its own job rather than being
# inherited from the nightly chain.
