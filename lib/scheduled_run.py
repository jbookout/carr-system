"""lib/scheduled_run.py — the ONE implementation of "what happened in a Claude
Code scheduled-task session", shared by the Stop hook and the manual CLI (rule
a8c55a47: a manual path and an automated path that do the same job must be the
same code).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Program 3's gate line: "Job failure becomes a durable failed
run, incident, or Work Request. It cannot exist only in stdout or a local log."
The ~17 Claude Code scheduled tasks on this Mac are PROMPTS, not scripts — they
have no exit code, so nothing wrote a row to ops.run when one of them failed.
This module reads a scheduled-task session's own transcript (the harness's
record of what actually happened) and turns it into the same shape of ops.run
call bin/nightly.sh's record_run() already makes for the launchd chain.

HOW IT KNOWS WHICH TASK. Proven pattern, copied from hooks/model-floor-gate.py
(measured against a real scheduled-run transcript on 2026-08-13): a scheduled
run's FIRST transcript record is a queue-operation whose `content` field opens
with `<scheduled-task name="..." file="...">`. Reading that attribute is immune
to whatever the session goes on to talk about; a plain substring search over the
transcript is not (an interactive session merely discussing a run's name would
false-positive).

HOW IT KNOWS THE OUTCOME. Deterministic signals only (rule 5e89c211: never spend
a cognition token on a decision already expressible as code) — this module does
NOT ask a model to judge whether the run "went well":
  - a PreToolUse gate DENY anywhere in the transcript (guard-unattended,
    model-floor-gate, escalation-gate, ...) means the run was actively stopped
    from doing its job -> failed, failure_class=gate_denied.
  - the run's last tool call before Stop came back is_error=true with nothing
    after it -> failed, failure_class=tool_error.
  - otherwise -> succeeded.
This intentionally does NOT try to parse task-specific semantic success (did
loop-drain close 3 loops, did restore-rehearse print PASS) — that would require
per-task parsing rules that drift from the prompts. It catches the category the
doctrine line is actually worried about: a run that stopped existing anywhere
but stdout.

SERVICE KEY = TASK NAME. ops/config/services.json registers one service per
scheduled task, keyed identically to the task's own directory name (taskId), so
no separate mapping table exists to fall out of sync. An unregistered task name
(one of the three currently-disabled tasks, or a brand new one nobody has added
yet) makes ops-record.py refuse with its own "no service registered" message
(exit 78) — logged, never fatal, and it names the fix.

nightly-record-layer IS a registered service already (the launchd chain's own
key). Its OUTER Claude Code session (the one that launches ./bin/nightly.sh) is
recorded under the SAME service but a DISTINCT run_key (RUN_KEY, below) so it
never collides with the chain's own per-step rows (nightly.cadence-engine,
nightly.exports, ...).
