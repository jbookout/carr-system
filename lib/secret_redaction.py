"""Best-effort redaction of secrets from untrusted child-process output.

Deterministic control-plane entrypoints run without ledger, provider, owner,
or live-ingest credentials in their own environment (see
``tools/control-plane.py``'s ``_execute_deterministic``). That boundary keeps
a child from being HANDED a secret; it does not stop the child's stdout or
stderr from ECHOING one anyway -- a misconfigured downstream call, a stack
trace that prints a DSN, a copy-pasted example. Failure evidence is the one
place raw child output is about to be written into a stored receipt, so it is
the one place this module is required to run first.

This is deliberately best-effort, not a guarantee: secret shapes evolve and a
genuinely novel one can still slip through. It is layered defense on top of
the credential-exclusion boundary above, not a replacement for it.
