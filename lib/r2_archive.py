r2_archive.py — the quota-guarded R2 uploader (ORDER 20).

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every document the factory produces gets an archive copy in
the Cloudflare R2 bucket `carr-documents`, so a file that lives on Joe's Mac and
in his OneDrive also lives somewhere neither a disk nor a sync client can lose.
`attachment.r2_key` is `not null unique` in 0001, so an attachment row cannot
exist until an object exists: the upload is what makes the row insertable, which
is why ORDER 13 had to leave the rows owed and why this module closes that.

THE QUOTA IS JOE'S REQUIREMENT AND IT IS A HARD CAP, NOT AN ALERT (2026-07-31).
Cloudflare's R2 free tier is 10 GB and the account is on it. A billing alert
tells you after the money starts; a cap refuses before it does. So:

  · `system_config` row `r2.quota_gb` holds the cap. WHEN THAT ROW IS ABSENT
    THIS MODULE DEFAULTS TO 8 GB — deliberately under the 10 GB free tier, so a
    missing config row can never be the reason a bill arrives.
  · THE PIPELINE IS THE BUCKET'S SOLE WRITER. Nothing else uploads: no Worker
    route, no dashboard habit, no public access of any kind. That is what makes
    a local ledger trustworthy enough to gate on.
  · Before every upload the ledger (`out/r2-usage.json`) is read and the upload
    is REFUSED if it would land past the cap. Nothing is deleted to make room,
    ever. The file stays on OneDrive, the archive copy is recorded as owed, and
    the report says exactly why.

THREE SOURCES OF TRUTH AND WHAT EACH IS FOR, because a quota guard that
under-counts is worse than no quota guard at all:
  1. the LEDGER — local, instant, and what the per-upload gate actually reads.
  2. the BUCKET's own reported size (`wrangler r2 bucket info`), consulted once
     per run rather than once per upload. It LAGS: measured 2026-07-31, two
     objects verified present by downloading them back still read as
     `object_count: 0` afterwards.
  3. the ATTACHMENT ROWS — the record layer's view, low by construction between
     an upload and the tap that writes its row.
THE LEDGER IS A FLOOR. Any source reporting MORE wins and rebuilds it upward;
any source reporting LESS is printed and never applied. Under-counting is the
only failure that costs money, so every ambiguity resolves upward.

Keys are content-addressed: `documents/<client_ref>/<sha256[:16]>/<filename>`.
Re-uploading the same bytes is a no-op that costs nothing and writes no second
row, which is what makes a rerun idempotent by construction rather than by a
check somebody has to remember.
