"""Evidence-only builders for typed cognition-job inputs.

The control plane invokes a builder before it can spend a cognition token.  A
builder may read canonical records, a command explicitly designated read-only,
or device evidence through the supplied collector.  It never calls a model,
performs I/O itself, or writes canonical state.  Missing, malformed, or
untraceable evidence is a refusal rather than a reason to make an input up.
