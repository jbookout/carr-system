"""canonical_freshness — WR-000040 AC-FRESH, as a library with no door of its own.

AC-FRESH: "A scheduled fast-forward keeps canonical within one day of
origin/main and pages visibly when the tree is dirty or the fast-forward
fails."

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured 2026-09-11. The canonical checkout at ~/carr-system
sat at d75a4ab6 — 111 commits behind origin/main, 0 ahead — and had done for
nine days. Twenty of its twenty-four "modified" paths held bytes that are
already on origin/main, in commits canonical has never pulled: the tree was not
dirty with anyone's work, it was dirty with the past. Every derived thing —
dependency caches, repo-vs-production checks, the Dell migration precondition —
inherited that.

WHY IT IS A LIBRARY AND NOT TWO SCRIPTS, which is a fact about this repository
rather than a style preference. ops/scac-mutation-inventory.mjs discovers a SCAC
ingress from the git index: `isScriptEntrypoint` counts any tracked file with a
shebang, and any .py whose source carries a main guard. Two new executable
scripts would have been two new rows in a SEALED inventory whose review overlay
(`current_source_review`) can only re-digest ingresses it already knows —
`assertCurrentSourceInventoryMatchesFixture` throws "unknown ingress" on an
added key. A new row therefore costs a whole registry successor. This module
carries NO shebang and NO such guard on purpose: it is reached only through
tools/repo-hygiene-janitor.py, which is already an inventoried ingress, so the
machinery lands against one already-registered row. That is the same shape
tools/room-bridge/worktree_runtime_isolation.py already uses, and the janitor
already knows how to load such a module by path.

── AN UNOBSERVED FACT IS NOT A CLEAN ONE ────────────────────────────────────

THE RULE THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND, and the one its first revision got wrong:
a git command that FAILS produces no measurement, and the absence of a
measurement must never be spelled the same way as a good one. `_Git.out` used to
take a `default=`, so a failed `git status` came back as the empty string and
read as ZERO tracked modifications, a failed `git rev-list` came back as the
word "unknown", and a failed `git log` came back as age zero. A repository whose
state could not be read at all therefore looked exactly like a clean, current
one, and the watchdog returned OK about it.

So there are three states here, not two, and every caller must name which it is
acting on: OBSERVED-AND-FINE, OBSERVED-AND-WRONG, and UNOBSERVED. `_Git.out`
returns None for the third and has no `default=` parameter to convert it into
the first. The fast-forward treats UNOBSERVED as FAILED, because a job that
cannot prove the tree holds nobody's edit has not earned the right to move the
branch. The watchdog treats it as an ALARM in its own right, with its own code
and its own named commands, because "I could not look" is a page-worthy fact
about the machine that is supposed to be looking.

── CANONICAL MEANS main, AND THAT IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED ───────────────────

Both modes are about ONE branch. "Keep canonical within one day of origin/main"
is a statement about main; measuring `HEAD..origin/main` from some other branch
answers a different question and calls the answer freshness. Worse, a feature
branch that happens to be a clean ancestor of origin/main fast-forwards
SUCCESSFULLY — the job would quietly drag somebody's branch onto main's tip,
report OK, and leave the actual main exactly as stale as it found it.

So: `fast_forward` refuses unless the checked-out branch is exactly `main`, and
`watchdog` alarms when it is not. A detached HEAD reads as the branch name
"HEAD", which is not `main`, and is refused by the same test rather than by a
special case.

── THE PROPERTY fast_forward() MUST HOLD ────────────────────────────────────

IT NEVER DESTROYS ANYTHING. The only git command that moves the branch is
`git merge --ff-only`, which fails rather than rewriting history, and it is not
reached at all unless the tree is on main and clean of TRACKED modifications.
No reset, no checkout of a path, no clean, no stash — a fast-forward that had to
discard something to succeed would be the exact failure this job is supposed to
page about.

THE GUARD IS SAMPLED TWICE, once before the fetch and once in the instant before
the merge, and that is not belt-and-braces. A fetch is a network round trip:
seconds, sometimes longer. A single sample taken before it is a statement about
the tree as it WAS, and the merge acts on the tree as it IS. Somebody starting
an edit in canonical while the fetch is in flight is the ordinary case, not an
exotic one, and `git merge --ff-only` will happily overwrite an unstaged
modification to a file the fast-forward touches. So `_preflight` runs again with
nothing between it and the merge.

TRACKED DIRT ONLY, which is the accepted plan's wording and not a softening.
Untracked paths are a separate settlement question: WR-000040's AC-CLEAN routes
each one to Joe for a discard-or-land ruling, and a freshness job that refused
to run until that ruling arrived would simply never run. So untracked paths are
REPORTED and do not block the fast-forward; tracked modifications block it
absolutely, because those are somebody's edit.

── THE PROPERTY watchdog() MUST HOLD ────────────────────────────────────────

IT OBSERVES THE REPOSITORY, NEVER THE JOB. A freshness machine whose only alarm
lives inside the freshness job is silent in the one failure that matters most —
the job never fired at all. launchd drops an agent whose plist is unloaded,
whose program is missing, or whose machine slept through every window, and it
says nothing. So `watchdog()` reaches its verdict from the repository alone and
never calls the fast-forward or reads anything it wrote. Sharing a module with
the job it watches does not weaken that; calling it would, and a test asserts
the call is absent.

WHAT IT PAGES ON: an unobservable repository; tracked dirt; canonical sitting on
a branch other than main; staleness past the AC-FRESH bar; canonical holding
commits origin/main does not have; and an unverifiable fetch.
WHAT IT DOES NOT PAGE ON, deliberately: untracked paths. AC-CLEAN routes those
to Joe for a per-path ruling, and a watchdog that paged daily about four paths
awaiting a human decision would train its reader to ignore it. They are COUNTED
and NAMED in every report — visible, never alarming.

HOW IT PAGES, by two independent routes so one channel failing is not silence:

  1. A durable record-layer problem report through the Bash door,
     `./run.sh call report-problem`, with the COMPLETE registered payload —
     idempotency_key, situation, title, desired_outcome, acceptance_criteria.
     The verb's validator (`validate` in mcp-server/src/work-request-intake.js)
     takes an EXACT key set and refuses an incomplete call outright, so a
     situation-only page is not a page at all — it is a rejected call.
  2. A nonzero exit, so bin/run-scheduled.sh records a failed run and the
     service shows red in `ops-record health`.

Route 1 failing never suppresses route 2. A watchdog that could be silenced by
an unreachable store would be worse than none.
