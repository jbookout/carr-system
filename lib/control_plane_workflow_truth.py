"""Pure row-to-truth adapter for the clean-start workflow census (V5-F09).

WHAT THIS IS. A deterministic function from already-authoritative rows to one
closed ``state`` and one closed ``disposition`` per workflow.  It reads nothing,
writes nothing, holds no authority, and is not a registry: every input is
supplied by a caller that read an existing authoritative surface, and every
output is a projection of those rows.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT.

* It is not an admission path.  ``ops.enqueue_job`` (migrations 0149 + 0334) is
  the only route into ``ops.job``, and this module never widens it.  The
  ``admissible_modes`` field mirrors that function's ladder exactly so a test
  can prove the projection is never MORE permissive than the database; a
  projection label can therefore never weaken the canary/live evidence fence.
* It is not an effect.  ``disable_false_operational`` and ``retire_duplicate``
  are REQUESTED dispositions.  Actually disabling a native scheduler still runs
  through ``ops.disable_legacy_schedule`` with Joe authority and its immutable
  enabled-to-disabled observation receipts (migrations 0176/0180/0182/0184).
  Nothing here can claim a native surface stopped firing.
* It invents no freshness.  ``ops.workflow_acceptance`` (0149 lines 195-211) has
  no expiry column, so acceptance evidence is never reported ``stale``.  The one
  place staleness is real is a native scheduler observation, and the window used
  is the registry's own ``observation_max_age_seconds`` -- the same value
  ``lib/control_plane_scheduler_cutover._require_observation`` enforces.
  Completion staleness comes from ``ops.completion_projection`` itself, which
  already derives ``unknown_stale`` from ``expires_at`` (migration 0431).

FAIL-CLOSED. An input the caller could not read is passed as ``UNREADABLE`` and
produces ``state='unknown'`` with ``disposition='hold_for_disposition'``.  A
malformed input raises ``WorkflowTruthContractError`` rather than being guessed
at.  Absent classification is ``hold_for_disposition``, never a repair claim.

THE DUPLICATE BOUNDARY, which is the correction this module exists to carry.
``ops.enqueue_job`` collapses two deliveries of the SAME workflow identity into
one canonical job (unique ``definition_key,definition_version,scheduled_for``
plus a unique idempotency key).  That is retry deduplication and nothing more.
It does NOT prevent two DISTINCT registered workflow identities that share one
``duplicate_group`` from each producing an executable job, because their
definition keys differ and no unique index spans the group.  Both cases are
modelled separately in ``duplicate_exclusion`` and must never be conflated:

    same_slot_idempotency  -- enforced today, inside ops.enqueue_job
    distinct_identity      -- NOT enforced today; the group-scoped exclusion is
                              bound phase-B migration work that must land inside
                              the existing ops.enqueue_job lifecycle, never a
                              second queue.
