"""rule_boot_gate.py — state and classification for the gated rule boot.

WHAT THE GATE IS. Joe asked for 100% recall on relevant rules. Nothing put the
rules in front of a context before it acted, so the design Jev chose (p=1.00)
is a gate: every session and every subagent must fetch every page of
standing-context `detail: "boot"` (mcp-server/src/rule-boot.js: the full text
of the always-on rules plus a one-line index of every active rule) before any
other tool call runs. hooks/rule-boot-gate.py enforces it on PreToolUse and
reads each fetch's answer on PostToolUse; hooks/gate-integrity.py arms (and
re-arms) it at SessionStart. They all import this module so the state layout,
the fetch-call grammar and the notices live in one place.

DATABASE AND CODE ONLY. The state here holds the digest, the page count and
which pages a context has fetched. It never holds rule text.

STATE LAYOUT (under out/rule-boot-gate/, gitignored, per machine):
    <session>/arm.json                    status (armed | unavailable |
                                          not_deployed), digest, pages_total,
                                          epoch
    <session>/agents/<agent>.epoch        one epoch per child context; a child
                                          SessionStart rotates only this file
    <session>/fetched/<agent>/<key>/      one directory per context and digest
        p<N>        page N's fetch was ATTEMPTED (PreToolUse)
        c<N>        page N came back as a real boot page (PostToolUse); holds
                    the page text's length, summed against total_chars
        u<N>        page N's answer, through a filter, was not the whole page:
                    not read, and not an outage either
        failed      a fetch came back as an error: the store is unreachable
        unsupported the Worker rejected detail=boot: not deployed yet
        d<H>-<rnd>  one deny, made when H pages were confirmed
Marker files, not a read-modify-write JSON, because a model often fetches the
pages in parallel and parallel hooks would otherwise lose each other's pages.
<key> is digest+the child's own epoch when its epoch file exists, digest alone
for a child that has not emitted SessionStart, and digest+the session epoch for
the main context. A child SessionStart therefore re-gates only that child. A
main SessionStart re-gates the main context, and a digest change re-gates every
context.

WHEN THE DIGEST MOVES MID-SESSION. Every boot page carries the corpus digest
and page count. When a fetch in any context returns a digest or page count
that differs from the arm, PostToolUse re-arms the session with it, so every
context of the session is held again at its next call until it has the new
pages. There is no timer and no network in the gate: a change is seen at
SessionStart or at the next boot fetch by any context in the session (every
new subagent makes one). A session whose contexts are all complete and that
starts no subagent keeps the digest it has until one of those happens.

DELIVERY BEFORE EFFECTS. Ordinary tools remain held until every full page is
confirmed. Outages, repeated attempts, missing adapters and unwritable state
are explicit failures, never evidence that rules were read. Fetches, rule-read
verbs and ToolSearch remain allowed for recovery. The diagnostic marker count
is capped; enforcement is not. Tool-less delegates need a fetch-capable route.

# THE BASH FETCH GRAMMAR (fixed 2026-09-27 after the gate held a live session's
# real fetches). A fetch is recognised by what the command DOES, not by one
# spelling of it:
#     [cd <absolute dir> &&] <run.sh> call standing-context ['<json>'] [redirect]... [| <filter>]...
# <run.sh> is any path (absolute, ~/, or relative to the cwd or the cd target)
# that resolves to this checkout's run.sh or a git worktree of the same repo.
# The only redirects are 2>&1, 2>/dev/null and </dev/null. Each <filter> only
# computes over what the fetch printed and cannot run, write or read anything else:
#     jq [display options] [filter]        any filter except the ones that read the
#                                          environment, other files or modules
#     python3|python -c '<code>'           code whose syntax tree is limited to pure
#                                          computation over stdin and print (_py_pure)
#     python3|python -m json.tool [opts]   (both Python forms only from a checkout root:
#                                          Python imports from its working directory)
#     head|tail [-n N | -N | -c N]         cat
# Anything else — `;`, `||`, `&`, a second `&&`, `$`, backticks, a file
# argument, a write, an unknown program — is not a fetch and is held as usual.
# A relative cd is refused because PostToolUse may see the post-cd cwd.
# WHAT A PIPED PAGE PROVES. A
# filter may keep the whole JSON, and then the page is confirmed like a direct
# read (digest, page, text and length). Or it may keep less: the page then
# counts when the call SUCCEEDED and its canonical JSON projection retains
# the upstream ok:true and rule_boot.digest fields. A context that fetched
# the page and kept the digest
# has done the read; demanding the whole JSON made sessions fetch every page
# twice. The cost, accepted on purpose: a filtered page has no length evidence,
# and a filter that keeps the digest and drops the text still counts.
# KNOWN RESIDUALS (Jev, 2026-09-27, kind rule-boot-gate-fetch-recognition-
# loopholes; top gap edited_worktree_run_sh 0.95), kept on purpose: the gate
# trusts the run.sh it recognises, and a session can edit a worktree's run.sh
# (or what it calls: tools/call-verb.py, tools/db-tap.py, mcp-server/local-verb.mjs)
# or put another jq/python3 first on PATH. Closing that means pinning the whole
# fetch chain, and the gate exists to put the rules in front of a cooperating
# context, not to sandbox one; the permission system still judges every command.
