build-lead-board.py — regenerate The Lead Board operating surface.
Derived VIEW. Reads the two sources of truth and writes lead-board.html.
Run by the weekly lead-system run (see DNA/Leads/lead-system-weekly.md) and any
session that moves a worked lead (refresh-on-change law, mirrors the Deal Room).

Usage:
  python3 build-lead-board.py [--recovery --reason WHY [--vault PATH]]

TWO SOURCE MODES (ORDER 26(b), the ORDER 29a pattern).
  normal     the canonical record-layer read: `candidate_pool` (the router rows
             plus mapped lane rows consumed by this builder, including
             renewal-radar) and the lead registry's export view. This is the
             only normal mode.
  recovery   an explicit, reasoned noncanonical Drive-file read for an outage.
             `--files` and `--records` are deliberately not caller-selectable.

The two modes share every transform. What changes is only where the RAW row came
from — an xlsx cell, a JSON object, or the `source_row` jsonb that stored that
same object verbatim. That is what makes byte-identical output provable rather
than hoped for: tools/parity-lead-board.py runs both and diffs the payload the
template consumes. Normal mode fails closed when canonical record ingress is
unavailable; legacy file reads require explicit recovery and are labeled
noncanonical.

CARR_ROOT defaults to the folder two levels up from this script (…/CARR AI).
Sources:
  <root>/DNA/Leads/lead-router-*.xlsx   (latest by name = the 9,320 reservoir)
  <root>/DNA/Leads/lead-registry.xlsx   (Registry tab = the worked call queue)

# ── Already-worked marking (2026-07-27) ────────────────────────────────────────
# 34 router rows matched a registry contact by name and carried NO mark, so the
# reservoir happily offered up people who are already an active deal — including
# Dell's. The detail panel has always had an "Already in system" field; nothing
# ever populated it for router rows. Name-only match on purpose: the registry
# holds a City/Market, not a street address, so address cannot be the join key.
# That makes this deliberately WIDE — a common name can collide. The mark
# therefore reads "check before calling", never "this is the same person", and
# it never removes anybody from the board (Joe qualifies, the system does not).

# THE REPO COPY IS CANONICAL as of 2026-08-20. This file is hand-authored
# SOURCE, not a render: the generator reads it and writes lead-board.html from
# it. It lived only in the vault, tracked by git nowhere, so its only history
# was Drive's own versioning. That cost a real bug — until 2026-08-09 the
# board's date classifier hardcoded today as 2026-07-13, so four weeks of leads
# rendered as future work rather than overdue, and the fix that repaired it had
# no commit behind it. A source file outside version control cannot be
# reviewed, diffed, or restored from the repo if the vault copy is damaged.
#
# The vault path stays as a FALLBACK rather than being deleted, because the
# cloud-only copy of this script (see manifest.tsv) runs from the vault with no
# repo beside it and would otherwise stop building the board entirely. Repo
# first, vault second, and the vault keeps only the BUILT board once that
# cloud-only surface is retired on its own gate.
# Resolved from the REPO ROOT, not from this file's own directory, because the
# two twins live in different folders (generators/ and shared/) and must find
# the one shell. In the vault's cloud-only copies this resolves to a path that
# does not exist, which is exactly what makes the fallback below fire there.
