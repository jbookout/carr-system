# Secrets Inventory + Send-Capability Audit

*Created 2026-07-30 by the record-layer build session (addendum A14/A15). Lives in the repo because ops config belongs beside the code that uses it; contains NO secret VALUES, ever — names, scopes, locations, blast radius only. Update on every credential added/rotated; the quarterly restore drill re-verifies this table.*

## The rule this file enforces (A15)

"No send tool" is true of the MCP server and exactly one hop wide. So every credential is classified by OUTBOUND CAPABILITY, and send-capable secrets live ONLY behind the human-gated route — never in the Worker, never in cron jobs, never in an automation scope.

| class | meaning | where allowed |
|---|---|---|
| SEND | can publish/message/email externally | human-gated route only (Joe triggers) |
| WRITE | mutates our own stores | MCP server write path, guarded jobs |
| READ | read/analytics only | cron jobs, Worker, read sessions |

## Current credentials (pre-build, exists today)

| name | class | scope | location | rotated | blast radius if leaked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blotato API key | **SEND** (posts to X/LinkedIn/FB/IG) | Joe's connected socials | Cowork connector + TO VERIFY any local copy | never | posts as Joe on every platform; drain credits |
| GitHub PAT (jbookout/carr-system) | WRITE | scope TO VERIFY — A14 requires single-repo scope; verify at next use, narrow if broader | local git credential store | never | repo tamper; NO PII once dumps are age-encrypted (A9), which is why encryption starts with the FIRST dump |
| Salesforce login (Joe) | WRITE (in SF) | Joe's profile, export disabled | Joe's head + browser profile | corp policy | CARR corporate data; browser-bound by design, never stored by us |
| CoStar / GCCMLS / CREXI logins | READ | market data | Joe's browser profile (automation Chrome profile) | never | data-license exposure; browser-bound by design |
| Google Drive (both partners) | WRITE | the vault | OS-level (Drive clients) | n/a | the whole vault; governed by Google account 2FA |
| Apple Notes MCP | READ (of Notes) | call recordings sweep (addendum E) | local Mac only | n/a | call transcripts; local-only by design |
| Make.com scenarios | TO AUDIT | which scenarios can EMIT (mail/webhook out)? | Make account | never | any emit-capable scenario is SEND; audit before exporters go live (A15) |
| MailerLite (planned, #95) | **SEND** (email) | newsletter | not yet created | — | mass email as Joe; human-gated route only |

## To be created at build (Mon 8/3) — with their rules

| name | class | scope | location | rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neon: carr_writer URL | WRITE | base tables, MCP write path only | Worker secret (wrangler) | NEVER handed to a build/chat session; sessions get branch creds |
| Neon: carr_reader URL | READ | views only, zero base-table grants | Worker secret + cron env | the default connection for everything that reads |
| Neon: branch creds | WRITE (branch) | rehearsal branches | issued per build session, short-lived | the ONLY creds a build session touches (A14) |
| CARR_DB_JOBS_URL (role `carr_jobs`) | WRITE (narrow) | the nightly jobs ONLY: insert next_action + event (cadence), insert/update the three content tables (metrics); reads are column-scoped so no phone, email or notes column is reachable, and no export view is granted | `~/.config/carr/db.env`, chmod 600, never in repo or vault | CREATED 7/31 by migration 0021 (ORDER 19a) with a random placeholder nobody recorded. JOE sets the real password by his own hand (`alter role carr_jobs password '<value>'`) and writes the DSN into db.env himself — no agent has ever held the value. This exists so carr_writer's DSN never has to sit on this Mac |
| Neon API key | READ (control plane) | consumption polling (A13) | cron env | budget alerts at 50/80%; works while compute suspended. AMENDED 7/30 (Joe): Free plan cannot pre-store a card, so card-at-upgrade IS the plan — the alert response is Joe upgrading (~2 min), documented in the vault runbook |
| Cloudflare: Worker OAuth (IdP) | n/a (auth layer) | allow-list of exactly TWO identities (joe, dell) | Worker config | token issuance rejects everyone else (A10); short access, long refresh. BUILT 7/31 (ORDER 9 phase 1, NOT yet deployed): `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`, KV namespace `OAUTH_KV`, allow-list in `mcp-server/src/identity.js`, access 1h / refresh 90d |
| GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID | n/a (auth layer) | upstream Google sign-in for the connector; scopes `openid email` only | Worker secret (wrangler) | JOE creates the OAuth client and runs `wrangler secret put` himself — Claude never holds the value. **WHERE IT LIVES** (verified in the console 2026-08-02, was undocumented and cost a detour to rediscover): Google account `joe.bookout.carr.us@gmail.com` — NOT Joe's personal `jbookout28@gmail.com` — project **CARR Record Layer** (`carr-record-layer`), client name **CARR MCP Worker**, created 2026-07-31. **TWO redirect URIs must stay registered**, because `callbackUri()` in `google-oidc.js` derives the redirect from whatever host the connector is reached on: `https://api.doctorcre.com/callback` (PRIMARY as of Dell's onboarding, 2026-08-02) and `https://api.practicecre.com/callback` (alias, and the rollback path — do NOT remove it). Registering only one means a connector reached on the other host fails Google sign-in with `redirect_uri_mismatch` |
| GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET | n/a (auth layer) | ditto | Worker secret (wrangler) | same rule. Never leaves the Worker; used only to exchange a sign-in code with Google |
| ~~PARTNER_TOKENS~~ | RETIRED 2026-08-03 | was an interim per-partner bearer for /mcp | **deleted** (Worker secret removed; code path gone) | Retired on exactly the terms it was written under. Evidence at retirement: Dell's connector live on oauth-google and he never made a single legacy call; Joe's last legacy call 2026-08-02 21:18Z with none since; no consumer in the repo, ~/.config/carr, LaunchAgents or cron. /mcp now accepts a provider-issued token and nothing else. |
| `PROBE_TOKENS` | WRITE (narrow — 3 verbs, locked server-side) | mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh only, one machine actor | Worker secret (JSON map, same shape as INGEST_TOKENS) + `~/.config/carr/mcp-tokens.env` key `CARR_MCP_PROBE_TOKEN` (600, outside the repo) | ADDED 2026-08-06 (loop #192), to re-credit the smoke suite after PARTNER_TOKENS' retirement above took its old bearer with it. NOT a rebuilt PARTNER_TOKENS: it authenticates as ONE actor ('smoke-probe', provisioned by `pipelines/provision-smoke-probe.sql`, not yet run) pinned server-side to the 'probe' capability profile (`mcp-server/src/mcp.js`) — reads, plus exactly log-activity/set-next-action/complete-action, the three verbs the suite only ever replays under a frozen idempotency key. `?profile=` cannot widen it; every other write verb refuses `not_in_profile`. Checked in `mcp-server/src/index.js` before the request reaches the OAuthProvider, so the human OAuth path is untouched. **Joe generates and pastes the token himself (`wrangler secret put PROBE_TOKENS`); Claude never holds the value.** Provisioning runbook: the header comment block in `mcp-server/smoke-reads.sh`, just above its PREFLIGHT. |
| Cloudflare: R2 keys | WRITE (objects) | attachments bucket | Worker secret | weekly R2 → second-store copy (attachments otherwise have zero backup) |
| Cloudflare: 2FA recovery codes | n/a | account recovery | OFFLINE with Joe (paper/vault, not a file) | A14 |
| age keypair (dump encryption) | n/a | decrypt pg_dumps | CREATED 7/30: private key ~/.config/carr/age-key.txt (600, local); public key in repo (backups-public-key.txt). ✅ OFFLINE COPY DONE — Joe confirmed 2026-08-02 the key is written down and held off the machine. The ⏳ owed-item is retired and the single-point-of-failure it tracked is closed | first dump encrypted + restore-verified 7/30 (A9). AUDIT NOTE 2026-08-02: that verification was a ONE-OFF done by hand and no restore CODE existed, so it could not be re-run or scheduled — `bin/restore-rehearse.sh` exists to make it repeatable and automatic |
| Healthchecks.io ping URLs | READ-ish (pings out to the service) | dead-man checks per job | cron env | the service does the alert-sending, so the no-send rule holds (A13) |
| ingest per-source tokens | WRITE (into inbox only) | one token per source (Notes sweep, share-sheet Shortcut, Make, MailerLite webhooks) | each sender + Worker secret | HMAC where the sender supports it; size cap; rate-limited (A11) |
| `INGEST_TOKENS` — keys `notes_sweep`, `calendar` | WRITE (into `ingest_inbox` only) | ORDER 12 lanes (a) and (c), local jobs on Joe's Mac | Worker secret (whole JSON map) + `~/.config/carr/ingest.env` (600, outside the repo, gitignored path) | **Joe generates and pastes both; Claude never holds either value.** `wrangler secret put` REPLACES the whole map, so re-put all keys together — audit Make.com for an existing ingest bearer FIRST (still TO AUDIT above). Setup steps: `DNA/Deal Management/record-layer/ingest-tokens-setup.md`. Not yet created as of 2026-07-31; both lanes exit 78 and queue their work until it is |
| `INGEST_TOKENS` — key `shortcut` (plus `shortcut_dell` at his onboarding) | WRITE (into `ingest_inbox` only) | the iOS share-sheet Shortcut, one key per phone | Worker secret + inside the Shortcut on the phone itself | one key per phone so a lost phone revokes one partner only, and `ingest_inbox.source` records which phone sent a row. Recipe: `DNA/Deal Management/record-layer/shortcut-recipe.md` |
| Blotato API key (metrics scope) | READ | analytics pull for placement_metric | cron env | if Blotato has no scoped keys (TO VERIFY at signup), the metrics job holds the full key and is therefore SEND-capable: it then runs ONLY in the human-gated environment, never open cron — decide at build, do not fudge |

## Standing obligations

- **Secret-scanning in CI** (A14): add a scan step to `tools/check.sh` or CI before Mon build ends; the repo must reject a commit containing a connection string.
- **Quarterly restore drill** (A14): decrypt last dump into a scratch branch, count rows vs `export_run`; log the drill in decision-history.
- **Legacy-consumer send audit** (A15): before exporters go live, walk every consumer of the exported files and record here which can send. Known today: the social pipeline reads calendar/batch files and posts via Blotato (SEND, human-gated at Joe's Blotato review); the Monday brief and heartbeat write files only (WRITE-local).
- **This file never contains a value.** A credential value found in the repo, the vault, or a chat transcript is an incident: rotate it, log it.
